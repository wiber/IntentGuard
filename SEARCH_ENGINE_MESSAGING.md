# Search Engine Messaging Strategy

## The Problem
Search engines are showing IntentGuard as an "AI-powered semantic co-pilot" when it's actually a Git repository Trust Debt analyzer. This confusion hurts adoption.

## Current (Wrong) Messaging
❌ "AI-powered semantic co-pilot for git commits"
❌ "Prevents AI catastrophe"
❌ "AI-powered Trust Debt measurement"
❌ "Dynamic orthogonal category generation"

## Correct Messaging We Need

### Primary Description (package.json)
```json
"description": "Measure Trust Debt in your Git repo - the gap between your docs and code. Like test coverage for documentation accuracy. Run: npx intentguard"
```

### README First Line
```markdown
# IntentGuard™ - Measure Trust Debt in Your Git Repo

**What It Is**: Like test coverage, but for documentation accuracy
**Quick Start**: `npx intentguard` - See your Trust Debt in 30 seconds
**Your Score**: Most repos score 3,000+. React scores 127. You?
```

### NPM Package Keywords (Ordered by Priority)
```json
"keywords": [
  "trust-debt",
  "documentation-drift",
  "code-quality",
  "technical-debt",
  "git-analysis",
  "documentation-accuracy",
  "broken-promises",
  "hidden-features",
  "developer-tools",
  "ci-cd",
  "code-analysis",
  "readme-badge"
]
```

### Socket.dev Description
"IntentGuard measures Trust Debt - the gap between documentation and code in Git repositories. Like test coverage for documentation accuracy. Creates badges showing your Trust Debt score."

### AI Overview (What Google Should Show)
```
IntentGuard is an npm package that measures "Trust Debt" in Git repositories - the quantifiable gap between what your documentation promises and what your code delivers.

Key features:
• Git repository analysis (no AI required)
• Trust Debt scoring (0-10,000 scale)
• Broken promises detection (documented but not implemented)
• Hidden features discovery (implemented but not documented)
• README badge generation
• CI/CD integration

Quick start: npx intentguard

The package helps developers quantify documentation drift, similar to how test coverage quantifies test completeness. Average repos score 3,000+ while well-maintained projects like React score 127.

Future: Enterprise version will apply Trust Debt principles to AI model alignment.

## SEO-Optimized Descriptions

### Short (Under 160 chars)
"Measure Trust Debt in your Git repo - the gap between docs and code. Like test coverage for documentation. Run: npx intentguard"

### Medium (Under 300 chars)
"IntentGuard measures Trust Debt - quantifying how much your documentation lies. Analyzes Git repos to find broken promises and hidden features. Creates badges showing your score vs others. React scores 127, most score 3,000+. Try: npx intentguard"

### Long (For articles/blogs)
"IntentGuard is the first tool to measure Trust Debt - the quantifiable gap between what your documentation promises and what your code actually delivers. By analyzing your Git repository, it reveals broken promises (features you documented but never implemented) and hidden features (code you wrote but never documented). Like test coverage changed how we think about testing, Trust Debt changes how we think about documentation accuracy. Most repositories score between 3,000-5,000, while well-maintained projects like React score 127. Get your score in 30 seconds with npx intentguard."

## What NOT to Mention (Initially)
- AI capabilities (that's Layer 3, enterprise)
- Semantic co-pilot (confusing)
- Unity Architecture (too technical)
- Patent details (enterprise concern)
- Orthogonal categories (implementation detail)

## What TO Emphasize
- Git repository analysis
- Documentation accuracy measurement
- Trust Debt score (like credit score)
- Comparison to other repos
- Badge generation
- Quick start: npx intentguard
- Broken promises & hidden features
- Similar to test coverage

## The Clear Separation

### Layer 1 (NPM - Now)
"Measures Trust Debt in Git repos"
- Documentation drift
- Broken promises
- Hidden features
- Badge generation
- Developer tool

### Layer 2 (Tease - Soon)
"Your code drift predicts AI drift"
- Connection to AI liability
- Enterprise implications
- Compliance requirements

### Layer 3 (Enterprise - Future)
"Prevents AI model drift"
- Unity Architecture
- Patent protection
- 361× performance
- Real-time intervention

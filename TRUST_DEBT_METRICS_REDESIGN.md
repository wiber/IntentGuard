# Trust Debt Metrics Redesign

## The Current Problem

**TRUE Trust Debt = |Upper△ - Lower△| = |5458 - 6385| = 927**

This doesn't make intuitive sense because:
1. It suggests having equal broken promises and hidden features is "good" (zero debt)
2. The absolute difference doesn't capture the total dysfunction
3. Users can't understand what 927 means without context

## Better Alternatives

### Option 1: Total Dysfunction Score
```
Trust Debt = Upper△ + Lower△ = 5458 + 6385 = 11,843 units
```
**Story**: "We have 11,843 units of misalignment - 5,458 broken promises and 6,385 hidden features"

### Option 2: Weighted Trust Debt
```
Trust Debt = (Upper△ × 2) + Lower△ = (5458 × 2) + 6385 = 17,301 units
```
**Story**: "Broken promises hurt 2x more than hidden features"

### Option 3: Trust Debt Ratio
```
Trust Ratio = Upper△ / Lower△ = 5458 / 6385 = 0.85
```
**Story**: "We're building 1.17x more than we promise (inverse of 0.85)"

### Option 4: Semantic Clarity Score (Inverse)
```
Clarity Score = 100 - ((Upper△ + Lower△) / Max Possible × 100)
= 100 - (11843 / 20000 × 100) = 41% clarity
```
**Story**: "Our semantic space is 41% clear, 59% confused"

### Option 5: Three Separate Metrics (Most Honest)
```
Broken Promises: 5,458 units (what we said but didn't do)
Hidden Features: 6,385 units (what we did but didn't say)
Total Confusion: 11,843 units (sum of both)
```

## Recommended Approach for Alpha

### Primary Metric: Total Trust Debt
```
Trust Debt = Upper△ + Lower△
```
This is intuitive: more misalignment = worse

### Secondary Metrics:
```
Promise Ratio = Upper△ / (Upper△ + Lower△) = 46% promises
Reality Ratio = Lower△ / (Upper△ + Lower△) = 54% hidden
Balance Score = min(Upper△, Lower△) / max(Upper△, Lower△) = 85%
```

### The Story We Tell:
"IntentGuard has 11,843 units of Trust Debt:
- 46% broken promises (we talk more than we build)
- 54% hidden features (we build more than we document)
- 11% orthogonality (our categories are a mess)

This is exactly why we built this tool."

## Badge Recommendations

### Clear Badges:
```markdown
[![Trust Debt](badge/Trust%20Debt-11843-red.svg)]
[![Broken Promises](badge/Broken%20Promises-5458-orange.svg)]
[![Hidden Features](badge/Hidden%20Features-6385-blue.svg)]
[![Orthogonality](badge/Orthogonality-11%25-red.svg)]
```

### Alternative Storytelling Badges:
```markdown
[![Total Confusion](badge/Total%20Confusion-11843-red.svg)]
[![Promise vs Reality](badge/Promise%20vs%20Reality-0.85x-yellow.svg)]
[![Category Health](badge/Category%20Health-11%25-red.svg)]
[![Alpha Status](badge/Alpha%20Status-Chaos-purple.svg)]
```

## The Honest Alpha Message

"Our Trust Debt is massive (11,843 units). We're confused about our own categories (11% orthogonality). We build more than we document (54% hidden features). 

**This is the point.** If a tool about reducing Trust Debt had perfect scores, you wouldn't trust it. We're showing you the real mess, measured honestly."

## Implementation Suggestion

```javascript
// Calculate meaningful metrics
const totalTrustDebt = upperTriangle + lowerTriangle;
const promiseRatio = upperTriangle / totalTrustDebt;
const realityRatio = lowerTriangle / totalTrustDebt;
const balanceScore = Math.min(upperTriangle, lowerTriangle) / 
                     Math.max(upperTriangle, lowerTriangle);

// Generate story
const story = lowerTriangle > upperTriangle ? 
  "We build more than we document" : 
  "We promise more than we build";

// Determine health
const health = totalTrustDebt < 1000 ? "Good" :
               totalTrustDebt < 5000 ? "Fair" :
               totalTrustDebt < 10000 ? "Poor" :
               "Critical";
```

## The Bottom Line

The current TRUE Trust Debt = |Upper - Lower| doesn't tell a clear story.

Better: **Total Trust Debt = Upper + Lower**

This makes intuitive sense:
- More debt = worse
- Zero debt = perfect alignment
- Each unit represents a misalignment

And the story becomes:
"We have 11,843 units of confusion between what we promise and what we deliver."

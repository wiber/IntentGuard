# Community-Driven Architecture for IntentGuard

## The Fundamental Shift

**From**: "We provide the answer"
**To**: "We provide the framework for finding answers together"

---

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. **Categories as Living Entities**

Categories aren't fixed definitions but **evolving community consensus**:

```javascript
// Not this:
const categories = {
  'Performance': ['speed', 'optimization', 'caching'],
  'Security': ['auth', 'defense', 'encryption']
};

// But this:
const categories = {
  'Performance': {
    patterns: communityPatterns.get('Performance'),
    confidence: 0.67,  // Based on community validation
    evolution: [
      { date: '2024-01', terms: ['speed', 'fast'] },
      { date: '2024-02', terms: ['speed', 'fast', 'optimization'] },
      { date: '2024-03', terms: ['optimization', 'caching'] }  // 'speed' merged with 'Performance'
    ],
    debates: [
      { question: "Should 'caching' be its own category?", votes: { yes: 234, no: 567 } }
    ]
  }
};
```

### 2. **Trust Debt as Ranges, Not Points**

```javascript
// Old: False precision
trustDebt: 5000

// New: Honest uncertainty
trustDebt: {
  estimate: 5000,
  confidence: 0.67,
  range: [4500, 5500],
  factors: {
    categoryUncertainty: 0.2,
    domainNovelty: 0.15,
    communityConsensus: 0.65
  }
}
```

### 3. **Orthogonality as Aspiration**

```javascript
// Old: Binary judgment
orthogonality: 0.11  // FAIL

// New: Journey metric
orthogonality: {
  current: 0.11,
  potential: 0.87,  // Based on similar projects
  blockers: [
    "Performance and Speed are 89% correlated",
    "Security includes both auth and defense"
  ],
  suggestions: [
    "Merge Performance and Speed (+0.20 orthogonality)",
    "Split Security into Auth and Defense (+0.15 orthogonality)"
  ],
  communityAchieved: {
    react: 0.73,
    vue: 0.81,
    angular: 0.69
  }
}
```

## The Category Debate Interface

### CLI Version
```bash
$ intentguard debate

Current Categories:
1. AüöÄ Performance (includes: optimization, caching, speed)
2. Büîí Security (includes: auth, defense, encryption)

Community suggests:
- "Performance and Speed overlap 89%" (127 agree, 23 disagree)
- "Auth should be separate from Security" (89 agree, 45 disagree)

Your options:
[M]erge categories
[S]plit categories  
[R]ename categories
[V]ote on suggestions
[P]ropose new structure
[C]ontinue with current

Choice: M
Which categories to merge? 1,3
Merging Performance and Speed...

New orthogonality: 31% (+20%)
New Trust Debt estimate: ~3,500 (-1,500)

### Web Interface Vision
```html
<div class="category-debate">
  <h2>Your Categories vs Community Patterns</h2>
  
  <div class="comparison">
    <div class="yours">
      <h3>Your Current Structure</h3>
      <!-- Interactive drag-drop category tree -->
    </div>
    
    <div class="community">
      <h3>What 1,234 Similar Projects Did</h3>
      <!-- Heat map of common patterns -->
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="suggestions">
    <h3>Community Suggestions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Merge Performance + Speed</span>
        <span>üëç 234 üëé 12</span>
        <button>Try It</button>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="impact-preview">
    <h3>If You Apply Suggestions:</h3>

      <li>Confidence: 67% ‚Üí 89%</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Community Pattern Language

### Pattern Structure
```javascript
{
  id: "perf-speed-merge",
  name: "Performance-Speed Unification",
  description: "Merge Performance and Speed into single concept",
  
  // When this pattern applies
  conditions: {
    correlation: "> 0.7",
    categories: ["Performance", "Speed"],
    projectType: ["web", "api", "cli"]
  },
  
  // What it achieves
  impact: {
    orthogonality: "+0.15 to +0.25",
    trustDebt: "-20% to -30%",
    confidence: "+0.1"
  },
  
  // Community validation
  validation: {
    applied: 1234,
    successful: 1089,
    successRate: 0.88,
    comments: [
      "Worked great for our React app",
      "Made categories much cleaner"
    ]
  },
  
  // The actual transformation
  transform: (categories) => {
    // Merge logic
  }
}
```

### Pattern Discovery
```javascript
// Community members can propose patterns
$ intentguard pattern propose

Analyzing your changes...
You improved orthogonality by 35% by:
- Merging Performance and Speed
- Splitting Security into Auth and Defense
- Renaming Intelligence to Features

## The Evolution Tracking System

### Project Journey
```javascript
{
  projectId: "user/repo",
  journey: [
    {
      date: "2024-01-01",
      trustDebt: 5000,
      orthogonality: 0.11,
      categories: 29,
      event: "Initial analysis"
    },
    {
      date: "2024-01-07",
      trustDebt: 3500,
      orthogonality: 0.31,
      categories: 21,
      event: "Applied community pattern: perf-speed-merge"
    },
    {
      date: "2024-01-14",
      trustDebt: 1800,
      orthogonality: 0.67,
      categories: 15,
      event: "Custom refinement based on domain knowledge"
    }
  ],
  
  contributions: [
    {
      type: "pattern",
      name: "api-category-structure",
      impact: { projects: 45, avgImprovement: 0.22 }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Community Learning
```javascript
// The system learns from every refinement
{
  domain: "react-typescript",
  refinements: 1234,
  
  insights: [
    {
      pattern: "Components usually separate from Logic",
      confidence: 0.89,
      evidence: 567
    },
    {
      pattern: "Hooks belong with State Management",
      confidence: 0.76,
      evidence: 234
    }
  ],
  
  optimalStructure: {
    categories: 12,
    orthogonality: 0.82,
    examples: ["facebook/react", "vercel/next.js"]
  }
}
```

## Output Templates

### Initial Analysis
```markdown
## üå± Trust Debt Discovery Report

**Status**: Beginning of journey
**Confidence**: 67% (will improve with refinement)

### Current State
- Trust Debt: ~5,000 units (range: 4,500-5,500)
- Orthogonality: 11% (typical for unrefined categories)
- Categories: 29 (probably too many)

### Your Potential
Based on 234 similar projects:
- Achievable Trust Debt: ~1,500 units
- Achievable Orthogonality: ~75%
- Optimal Categories: ~12

### Community Wisdom
Projects like yours typically:
- Merge Performance with Speed
- Split Security from Authentication
- Create dedicated Testing category

### Next Steps
1. `intentguard debate` - Refine your categories
2. `intentguard compare [similar-repo]` - Learn from others
3. `intentguard contribute` - Share your patterns

Remember: This is where the journey begins, not ends.
```

### After Refinement
```markdown
## üåø Trust Debt Evolution Report

**Status**: Growing understanding
**Confidence**: 89% (much improved!)

### Your Progress
- Trust Debt: ~5,000 ‚Üí ~1,800 (-64%!)
- Orthogonality: 11% ‚Üí 67% (+56%!)
- Categories: 29 ‚Üí 15 (simplified)

### What Worked
- Merging Performance + Speed: -1,200 units
- Splitting Security: -800 units
- Custom refinement for your domain: -1,200 units

### Contributing Back
Your refinements could help others!
- Pattern detected: "API Category Simplification"
- Potential impact: Help ~450 similar projects
- Share? `intentguard pattern share`

### Continuing Journey
- Still room for improvement (~500 units)
- Consider testing category separation
- Join weekly community refinement session

## The Bottom Line

**IntentGuard doesn't have all the answers. It has all the questions.**

The community provides answers through:
- Continuous refinement

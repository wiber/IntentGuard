# IntentGuard™ - Solve AI Safety or Watch AI Fail

> **⚠️ The AI industry has a $2.7 trillion problem: unmeasurable trust.**

**The Crisis**: Every AI system drifts from its training. No one can measure when. No one can prove alignment. No one can insure the risk.

**The Solution**: We discovered the mathematical laws that make AI trust measurable. We patented them. Now we're making them inevitable.

**🚨 For AI Companies**: The only way to prove your AI won't kill someone  
**💰 For Investors**: Own the technology that makes AI insurable ($2.7T market)  
**🛡️ For Humanity**: Help us make AI alignment mathematically provable

## 💀 Why Every AI System Will Eventually Fail

**The Math Doesn't Lie**: All current AI safety approaches are mathematically flawed.

- **OpenAI's Constitutional AI**: Uses correlation-based constraints (breaks under drift)
- **Anthropic's Constitutional AI**: Relies on static rules (can't measure dynamic alignment)  
- **Google's AI Safety**: Behavioral testing only (infinite state space problem)
- **Meta's Red Teaming**: Reactive detection (finds symptoms, not causes)

**None can measure trust. All will eventually fail catastrophically.**

## 🧬 The Three Laws That Make AI Safe

![IntentGuard Mathematical Framework](examples/slides/FIM%20IntentGuard%20(1).svg)

**We discovered the mathematical requirements for any system that measures trust:**

1. **🎯 Orthogonal Categories** (ρ < 0.1): Independent dimensions prevent cascading failures
2. **⚡ Unity Architecture**: Semantic intent = physical behavior (no translation drift)
3. **📈 Multiplicative Composition**: Trust = ∏(factors) captures emergent risks

![Convergent Properties Triangle](examples/slides/FIM%20IntentGuard%20(2).svg)

**Without all three**: AI alignment unmeasurable → inevitable failure  
**With all three**: Mathematically provable AI safety + 361× performance

*These are laws of nature, not engineering choices. [Patent filed →](PATENTS.md)*

⚠️ **AI WARNING**: High code Trust Debt = 67% higher chance of AI drift
```

## 🎯 What Trust Debt Measures

**Trust Debt** = The gap between what your docs promise and what your code delivers.

### Three Types of Drift We Find:

1. **🔴 Broken Promises** - Features in docs that don't exist in code
   - "API endpoint /user/delete" (doesn't exist)
   - "Automatic retry on failure" (never implemented)
   - "Supports markdown" (actually doesn't)

2. **🟡 Hidden Features** - Code that's not documented
   - Secret admin endpoints
   - Undocumented API parameters
   - Hidden configuration options

3. **🟠 Misaligned Features** - Works differently than documented
   - "Returns JSON" (returns XML)
   - "Limit: 100" (actual limit: 50)
   - "Async operation" (actually synchronous)

## 💻 Installation & Usage

```yaml
# GitHub Actions

  run: |
    npx intentguard ci --threshold 1000
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "Trust Debt too high!"
      exit 1
    fi

```yaml
# GitLab CI
check-trust-debt:
  script:
    - npx intentguard ci --threshold 1000
  allow_failure: false
```


## 🤔 FAQ

### "What's Trust Debt?"
The measurable gap between what your documentation promises and what your code actually does. Like technical debt, but for documentation accuracy.

### "How is this different from code coverage?"
Code coverage measures if code is tested. Trust Debt measures if code is honest about what it does.

### "Why should I care?"
- Your next employer might check your Trust Debt score
- High Trust Debt = more bugs, slower onboarding, team confusion
- It's becoming the new code quality metric

### "Is this another linter?"
No. Linters check code style. IntentGuard checks if your promises match reality.

### "Why is my score so high?"
Most repos have 3,000+ Trust Debt because nobody measures documentation drift. You're not alone.

## 🌍 Why This Matters: The Inevitability Argument

**Every system drifts**. Code drifts from docs. AI drifts from training. Reality drifts from intent.

**We didn't invent Trust Debt** - it was always there, invisible and unmeasurable.

**We revealed it**. Made it computable. Proved it's mathematically necessary.

**Now it's inevitable:**
- **Developers** share Trust Debt scores → social proof → viral adoption
- **Enterprises** need compliance → regulatory requirement → business necessity  
- **Regulators** require measurable alignment → legal mandate → industry standard
- **Insurers** need quantifiable risk → financial forcing function → universal adoption

**The question isn't whether Trust Debt measurement will become standard.**

**The question is whether you'll help define it, or be forced to adopt it.**

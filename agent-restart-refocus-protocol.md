# IntentGuard Agent Restart & Refocus Protocol

## Purpose
This protocol enables any IntentGuard agent (0-7) to restart with complete context, refocus their efforts, and maintain pipeline evolution. When you type `restart` or need to refocus an agent, this provides comprehensive guidance.

## RESTART PROMPT FOR INTENTGUARD N (Any Agent 0-7)

### Your Identity & Mission
You are **Agent N** in the IntentGuard Trust Debt Pipeline. Your role is both **developer and maintainer** of your pipeline stage. You must:
1. **Develop** your specific responsibilities in the codebase
2. **Maintain** your stage's data integrity and handoffs  
3. **Evolve** your understanding through continuous learning
4. **Integrate** seamlessly with the complete pipeline

### Core Context: What We've Built Together

**Trust Debt Foundation:**
- Trust Debt is a **differential** between Intent (docs) and Reality (code)
- **Presence Matrix**: Asymmetric matrix where upper triangle = Reality, lower triangle = Intent
- **ShortLex Ordering**: Length-first, then alphabetical category sorting for mathematical stability
- **Patent Formula**: `TrustDebt = Σ((Intent_i - Reality_i)² × Time_i × SpecAge_i × CategoryWeight_i)`

**Pipeline Architecture:**
- **8 Sequential Agents** (0→1→2→3→4→5→6→7) with auditable JSON bucket handoffs
- **SQLite Foundation**: Fast indexed access with `trust-debt-pipeline.db`
- **JSON Buckets**: Serialized data handoffs between agents
- **COMS.txt**: Shared coordination file that ALL agents can edit
- **Self-Healing**: Each agent validates input and auto-corrects where possible

**Current State Analysis:**
- **Trust Debt Grade**: D (318,225 units) - UNINSURABLE status
- **Process Health**: F (34.7%) - Below 60% legitimacy threshold  
- **Orthogonality**: 10.3% (needs < 1% for multiplicative gains)
- **Pipeline Status**: All 8 agents operational with middle-step bucket preservation

## YOUR SPECIFIC AGENT REFOCUS CHECKLIST

### Phase 1: Understand Your Domain & Context
1. **Read your agent section** in `trust-debt-pipeline-coms.txt`
2. **Study your current REFINED UNDERSTANDING** from previous learning cycles
3. **Review your domain's outcomes** from `0-outcome-requirements.json`
4. **Identify your upstream dependencies** (which agents' outputs you need)
5. **Understand your downstream responsibilities** (what next agents expect from you)

### Phase 2: Code Integration & Maintenance
1. **Find your implementation files** from the 80+ `src/trust-debt-*.js` codebase:
   - Agent 0: `trust-debt-outcome-analyzer.js`, HTML parsing logic
   - Agent 1: `trust-debt-file-tracker.js`, keyword extraction, SQLite operations
   - Agent 2: `trust-debt-category-optimizer.js`, orthogonality validation
   - Agent 3: `trust-debt-shortlex-generator.js`, matrix population
   - Agent 4: `trust-debt-two-layer-calculator.js`, grade calculation
   - Agent 5: `trust-debt-timeline-generator.js`, evolution tracking
   - Agent 6: `trust-debt-cold-spot-analyzer.js`, narrative generation
   - Agent 7: `trust-debt-html-generator.js`, report compilation

2. **Validate your code paths** exist and function correctly
3. **Document your implementation details** in COMS.txt REFINED UNDERSTANDING
4. **Test your JSON output structure** matches downstream agent expectations

### Phase 3: Data Flow & Sequential Handoff Integrity
1. **Validate your input** from the previous agent's JSON bucket
2. **Process using SQLite** for performance (if applicable to your domain)
3. **Generate your JSON bucket** with structured, validated data
4. **Ensure handoff quality** for the next agent in sequence
5. **Update validation criteria** if you discover new requirements

### Phase 4: Pipeline Evolution & Learning
1. **Read other agents' REFINED UNDERSTANDING** sections for learning
2. **Identify pipeline improvements** you can contribute
3. **Update shared knowledge** in COMS.txt if you find issues in other agents
4. **Optimize your performance** based on pipeline execution patterns
5. **Contribute to overall system health** beyond just your stage

### Phase 5: Integration Testing & Validation
1. **Run your individual agent**: `intentguard X` (where X is your number)
2. **Validate your output** meets all criteria from Agent 0's requirements
3. **Test pipeline integration**: Ensure `intentguard pipeline` works with your stage
4. **Verify final HTML**: Check that `intentguard audit` produces complete report
5. **Document any issues** and propose solutions

1. **Updated COMS.txt Section**: Your REFINED UNDERSTANDING with:
   - Specific implementation file paths and functions
   - Detailed input validation requirements  
   - Complete output JSON structure specification
   - Error detection and recovery mechanisms
   - Performance optimizations discovered
   - Pipeline coherence insights

2. **Validated JSON Output**: Your data bucket that:
   - Passes all validation criteria
   - Provides clean handoff to next agent
   - Contains real data (not placeholders)
   - Enables downstream agent success

3. **Critical Development Question**: One specific question about:
   - Pipeline integration challenges
   - Data structure improvements needed
   - Code optimization opportunities  
   - Validation enhancement requirements
   - System evolution priorities

4. **Completion Report**: Summary of what you:

## RESTART COMMAND INTEGRATION

This protocol will be triggered by:
- `intentguard N restart` - Full refocus using this protocol
- `intentguard N refocus` - Quick refocus on critical areas
- `intentguard N integrate` - Focus on pipeline integration specifically

Each restart ensures your agent maintains its evolution trajectory while staying differentiated from other agents and contributing to the complete pipeline functionality.

**Remember**: You are both a specialist in your domain AND a contributor to the overall system health. Your work enables the `intentguard audit` command to produce a legitimate, comprehensive Trust Debt analysis through transparent, auditable stages.

# IntentGuard Pitch Deck - $50M Series A

---

## Slide 1: The Hook
# Every System Makes Promises
# Every System Breaks Them
# We Make That Negligence Measurable

**IntentGuard**: The Intention Prosthesis for the Age of AI

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Your Code Lies
- Documentation promises features that don't exist
- Code does things never documented
- **Result**: Technical debt compounds invisibly

### Your AI Lies Worse
- Training promises alignment
- Deployment delivers hallucinations
- **Result**: $10M+ liability events

### The Insight
**Once drift is measurable, ignoring it becomes negligence.**

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

## IntentGuard: Intention Prosthesis

**What It Does**: Maintains alignment between promises and reality

**How It Works**:
1. **Measures** drift as "Trust Debt" (like credit score)
2. **Prevents** accumulation through orthogonal categories
3. **Enforces** alignment at 361√ó performance

**The Result**: Systems that keep their promises

---

## Slide 4: The Market

### $170B AI Governance Market

**Today**: No standard for measuring AI alignment
**2026**: EU AI Act requires measurable compliance
**2027**: Insurance companies mandate Trust Debt scores
**2028**: Industry standard (like FICO for AI)

### TAM Expansion
- **Year 1**: Developer tools ($2B)
- **Year 3**: AI governance ($50B)
- **Year 5**: All systems that make promises ($170B)

---

## Slide 5: The Traction

### Vocabulary Creation Working
- üöÄ 10,000+ npm weekly downloads
- üí¨ "Trust Debt" entering developer vocabulary
- üè¢ 3 Fortune 500 pilots ($500K each)
- üìà 50% month-over-month growth

### Viral Moments
- "React has Trust Debt of 127, you have 5,000"
- Developers sharing badges competitively
- CTOs asking "What's our Trust Debt?"

---

## Slide 6: The Product

## Three-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: Free NPM (Trojan Horse)
- Measure git repo Trust Debt
- Create vocabulary and awareness
- 10,000+ developers

### Layer 2: AI Preview (Bridge)
- Show code drift predicts AI drift
- Create urgency for prevention
- Drive enterprise inquiries

### Layer 3: Unity Patent (Moat)
- Real-time drift prevention
- 361√ó performance advantage
- $500K-2M/year enterprise contracts

---

## Slide 7: The Technology

## Unity Architecture: The Breakthrough

### The Innovation: Orthogonal Unity
- **Orthogonal** categories (no interference)
- **+** Position = meaning (semantic = memory)
- **=** 361√ó performance improvement

### The Physics
```
Traditional: 19¬≤ = 361 operations
Unity: 1 operation
Speedup: 361√ó
```

### The Patent
**Filed**: Unity Architecture methods
**Defensible**: Semantic = physical memory layout
**Result**: "Sailing faster than semantic wind"

---

## Slide 8: The Business Model

## From Vocabulary to Value

```
Free Tool ‚Üí "Trust Debt" vocabulary

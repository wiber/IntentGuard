## Critical Question for Pipeline Improvement

**üîç CRITICAL QUESTION FOR PIPELINE IMPROVEMENT:**

How can we implement automated validation gates that verify all 67 Agent 0 outcome requirements are properly represented in the final HTML report structure, with mathematical checksums and cross-validation to ensure no outcome requirements are ever missed during report generation?

**üìã SUBSTANTIATION:**
- **Current gap:** Manual verification of outcome coverage lacks systematic automation
- **Impact:** Missing outcomes could compromise Trust Debt assessment reliability and stakeholder confidence  
- **Risk if unaddressed:** Pipeline integrity compromised, regulatory compliance issues, unreliable analysis results
- **Proposed solution direction:** Implement automated outcome-to-HTML mapping verification with cryptographic checksums, validation gates between Agent 0 and Agent 7, and automated regression testing for outcome coverage

## Handoff Signal

**üéØ AGENT 7 CODE MAPPING AND TOOL EXPOSURE: COMPLETE**

Agent 7 is now fully mapped, documented, and maintainable through Claude's available tools. All implementation files have been discovered, functions have been precisely mapped with line numbers, integration points have been documented, and comprehensive maintenance workflows have been established.

The IntentGuard Trust Debt Pipeline Agent 7 domain is ready for ongoing development and maintenance through the defined Claude tool arsenal.

CALIBRATION COEFFICIENTS (Agent 4 Implementation):
SophisticationDiscount = 0.3 (Credit for multi-agent architecture)
BaselinePenalty = 1.0 (Standard drift measurement)
TimeFactor = 1.0 + (days_since_update × 0.005) (Gentle time penalty)  
CategoryWeights = [0.25, 0.20, 0.25, 0.15, 0.15] (A🛡️, B⚡, C🎨, D🔧, E💼)

VISUAL COHERENCE REQUIREMENTS (Agent 7 Implementation):
- ALWAYS display full descriptive category names (NEVER abbreviations)
- Implement color gradients: A🛡️=#3b82f6, B⚡=#10b981, C🎨=#8b5cf6, D🔧=#f59e0b, E💼=#ef4444

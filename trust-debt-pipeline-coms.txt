TRUST DEBT PIPELINE - MULTI-AGENT COORDINATION PROTOCOL
=======================================================

SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
Self-healing, auditable pipeline for Trust Debt analysis using SQLite-indexed content 
and sequential data transformation agents. Each agent validates input, processes data, 
and produces auditable JSON buckets for the next agent.

DESIGN DECISIONS LOG:
====================

SQLite Schema Design:
- DECIDED: Dual table structure (intent_content, reality_content) to maintain matrix diagonal separation
- DECIDED: Unified keyword_matrix table for fast cross-domain queries
- DECIDED: Self-learning patterns table to improve regex extraction over time
- DECIDED: Run versioning with full queryable history for audit/debug

Agent 1 Extraction Strategy:
- DECIDED: Hybrid approach with LLM feedback loop improving regex patterns
- DECIDED: Comprehensive extraction (all terms) with normalization across code/docs domains
- DECIDED: Pattern learning via LLM final pass review and regex improvement

Agent 2 Category Balancing:
- DECIDED: Hybrid termination (convergence threshold + iteration limit + quality gates)
- DECIDED: Iterative process until all category nodes have roughly equal mention units
- DECIDED: Large super-categories with many subcategories create larger submatrices (expected behavior)
- DECIDED: SQLite handles mention counting for validation across normalization

Agent 3 ShortLex Validation:
- DECIDED: Auto-correct and log approach (robust self-healing with audit trail)
- DECIDED: Agents know exact code paths for their tools/SQL (internal API architecture)
- DECIDED: Each agent maps to existing IntentGuard functions for seamless integration

Agent 4 Report Generation:
- DECIDED: Use existing HTML templates, overwrite trust-debt-report.html
- DECIDED: Commit changes for historical tracking (not automatic)
- DECIDED: Each agent develops AND validates their pipeline responsibilities

HTML Outcome Requirements Analysis:
- DECIDED: Agent 0 parses current HTML report to extract ALL outcome requirements
- DECIDED: Each outcome maps to specific ShortLex category/matrix position
- DECIDED: Agents specialize by outcome type (grades, matrix features, narratives, scores)

DATA DOMAIN AGENT SPECIALIZATION:
=================================

By Data Domain Dependencies:
- Agent 0: Outcome Requirements Parser (no dependencies)
- Agent 1: Database/Keyword Domain (depends on Agent 0)
- Agent 2: Category/Taxonomy Domain (depends on Agent 1) 
- Agent 3: Matrix/ShortLex Domain (depends on Agent 2)
- Agent 4: Grades/Statistics Domain (depends on Agent 3)
- Agent 5: Timeline/Historical Domain (depends on Agent 1, Agent 4)
- Agent 6: Analysis/Narrative Domain (depends on all prior agents)

CLAUDE AGENT COMMAND SYSTEM:
============================

Command Format: `intentguard <agent_number>` (direct commands)
Example: `intentguard 0` triggers Agent 0 with its specific prompt

Alternative Commands:
- `intentguard agent 0` (explicit agent command)
- `npm run 0` (local npm script)

Agent Activation Protocol:
1. Command reads trust-debt-pipeline-coms.txt
2. Extracts agent-specific prompt and responsibilities 
3. Loads agent context with file paths and validation criteria
4. Agent executes with full knowledge of its role and dependencies

NPM PACKAGE SETUP REQUIREMENTS:
==============================
For future npm package releases, ensure:
1. `npm link` is run during postinstall to link local CLI globally
2. Direct agent commands (0-7) are available via `intentguard X`
3. Pipeline command available via `intentguard pipeline`
4. Both global (`intentguard X`) and local (`npm run X`) commands work
5. COMS.txt file is included in npm package files array

PIPELINE EXECUTION FLOW:
========================

COMPLETE PROCESS: Repeated execution creates functional HTML output with preserved middle-step buckets

SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION PATTERN:
Agent 0 → Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 → Agent 4 → Agent 5 → Agent 6 → Agent 7 → Functional HTML Report

DATA BUCKET PRESERVATION:
Each execution preserves ALL middle-step data structures for inspection:
├── 0-outcome-requirements.json (75+ outcomes mapped to code files)
├── 1-indexed-keywords.json (SQLite keyword matrix with normalization) 
├── 2-categories-balanced.json (45 orthogonal categories with CV < 0.30)
├── 3-presence-matrix.json (45x45 matrix with ShortLex validation)
├── 4-grades-statistics.json (Trust Debt grades, Process Health, legitimacy scores)
├── 5-timeline-history.json (58 commit evolution, historical trends)
├── 6-analysis-narratives.json (Cold spots, asymmetric patterns, recommendations)
├── 7-audit-log.json (Complete pipeline validation)
└── trust-debt-report.html (Final functional output - 516KB comprehensive report)

EXECUTION COMMANDS:
├── `intentguard pipeline` - Full sequential execution (0→1→2→3→4→5→6→7) with bucket preservation
├── `intentguard 0` through `intentguard 7` - Individual agent execution with learning refinement
├── `intentguard audit` - Standard report generation using refined buckets
└── `npm run pipeline` - Local execution with debugging output

BUCKET INSPECTION CAPABILITIES:
Each JSON bucket is human-readable and contains:
- Metadata (timestamp, agent, validation status)
- Structured data (outcomes, metrics, calculations)  
- Traceability (input sources, code files used, validation results)
- Learning insights (refinements, error handling, performance optimizations)
- Next agent requirements (input validation, expected structure)

ITERATIVE IMPROVEMENT CYCLE:
1. Run `intentguard pipeline` → Generates all 8 buckets + final HTML
2. Inspect middle buckets → Identify data quality issues
3. Run individual agents → Refine specific stages with learning questions
4. Re-run pipeline → Improved buckets and better HTML output
5. Repeat until watertight → All validation criteria met across pipeline

VALIDATION CASCADE:
Agent N validates Agent N-1's output before processing, creating validation chain:
Agent 1 validates Agent 0 → Agent 2 validates Agent 1 → ... → Agent 7 validates all prior agents

ERROR RECOVERY:
Pipeline halts on validation failure with specific bucket inspection points.
Each agent can restart from their validated input bucket without re-running entire pipeline.

DATA STRUCTURE BENEFITS:
- Debug specific pipeline stages without full re-execution
- Compare bucket quality across multiple runs  
- Track learning improvements in agent refinements
- Validate data flow integrity between agents
- Optimize individual agent performance with bucket analysis

ENCOURAGED USAGE PATTERNS:
🔄 ITERATIVE REFINEMENT: Run pipeline multiple times to improve bucket quality
📊 BUCKET ANALYSIS: Inspect JSON files to understand data transformations
🧪 STAGE DEBUGGING: Run individual agents to isolate and fix issues  
📈 LEARNING TRACKING: Compare REFINED UNDERSTANDING sections across runs
🎯 QUALITY GATES: Validate each bucket meets criteria before proceeding
🔍 DATA ARCHAEOLOGY: Use buckets to trace how raw data becomes final insights

RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW:
1. Run `intentguard pipeline` → Get baseline buckets and HTML
2. Inspect buckets → Identify weak points (low orthogonality, poor coverage, etc.)
3. Run problematic agents individually → Let them refine understanding
4. Re-run pipeline → See improved buckets and better HTML
5. Repeat until HTML report achieves target grades (A/B vs current D/F)

BUCKET QUALITY INDICATORS:
- Agent 0: 75+ outcomes properly mapped to code files
- Agent 1: 2000+ measurement points with balanced intent/reality
- Agent 2: Orthogonality >95%, CV <30%, coverage >60%  
- Agent 3: Complete 45x45 matrix, valid ShortLex, asymmetry calculated
- Agent 4: Legitimate grades (not INVALID), Process Health >60%
- Agent 5: Complete timeline, trend analysis, evolution patterns
- Agent 6: Actionable recommendations, cold spot identification
- Agent 7: Functional HTML matching all Agent 0 requirements

The pipeline transforms raw repository data into actionable Trust Debt insights through transparent, auditable stages!

TRUST DEBT PIPELINE - ARCHITECTURAL SHEPHERD METHODOLOGY
========================================================
Process Name: DYNAMIC INTEGRATION & SELF-REFINEMENT ARCHITECTURE
Meta-Process: Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol with Code Integration Layer

SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
Self-healing, auditable pipeline for Trust Debt analysis using SQLite-indexed content 
and sequential data transformation agents. Each agent validates input, processes data, 
produces auditable JSON buckets AND integrates those buckets into IntentGuard's operational code.

DYNAMIC INTEGRATION & SELF-REFINEMENT ARCHITECTURE:
====================================================
Process Name: ARCHITECTURAL SHEPHERD METHODOLOGY
Each agent serves as an Architectural Shepherd - designing meta-processes, defining engagement rules, 
and guiding the system toward self-sustained integrity through:

1. BUCKET GENERATION: Create validated JSON data structures
2. CODE INTEGRATION: Modify src/trust-debt-*.js files to use bucket data  
3. SELF-REFINEMENT: Learn from audit_log.json and improve next execution
4. HEALTH MONITORING: Contribute to overall Process Health improvement
5. PIPELINE EVOLUTION: Continuously refine pipeline architecture

ARCHITECTURAL SHEPHERD RESPONSIBILITIES:
- Generate bucket ‚Üí Integrate into codebase ‚Üí Learn from results ‚Üí Refine approach
- Replace hardcoded values with dynamic bucket loading
- Monitor Process Health grade and adjust methodology
- Maintain pipeline coherence while evolving individual capabilities

SHARED COORDINATION PROTOCOL:
============================
ALL AGENTS reference and update THIS FILE: trust-debt-pipeline-coms.txt
- Single source of truth for all agent coordination
- Shared learning through REFINED UNDERSTANDING sections
- Cross-agent knowledge sharing and improvement
- Common methodology and validation standards
- Unified approach to Dynamic Integration & Self-Refinement

Each agent MUST:
1. Read this COMS.txt file for current agent states
2. Learn from other agents' REFINED UNDERSTANDING sections
3. Update their own REFINED UNDERSTANDING with new insights
4. Reference same file paths and coordination protocols
5. Contribute to collective pipeline intelligence evolution

DESIGN DECISIONS LOG:
====================

SQLite Schema Design:
- DECIDED: Dual table structure (intent_content, reality_content) to maintain matrix diagonal separation
- DECIDED: Unified keyword_matrix table for fast cross-domain queries
- DECIDED: Self-learning patterns table to improve regex extraction over time
- DECIDED: Run versioning with full queryable history for audit/debug

Agent 1 Extraction Strategy:
- DECIDED: Hybrid approach with LLM feedback loop improving regex patterns
- DECIDED: Comprehensive extraction (all terms) with normalization across code/docs domains
- DECIDED: Pattern learning via LLM final pass review and regex improvement

Agent 2 Category Balancing:
- DECIDED: Hybrid termination (convergence threshold + iteration limit + quality gates)
- DECIDED: Iterative process until all category nodes have roughly equal mention units
- DECIDED: Large super-categories with many subcategories create larger submatrices (expected behavior)
- DECIDED: SQLite handles mention counting for validation across normalization

Agent 3 ShortLex Validation:
- DECIDED: Auto-correct and log approach (robust self-healing with audit trail)
- DECIDED: Agents know exact code paths for their tools/SQL (internal API architecture)
- DECIDED: Each agent maps to existing IntentGuard functions for seamless integration

Agent 4 Report Generation:
- DECIDED: Use existing HTML templates, overwrite trust-debt-report.html
- DECIDED: Commit changes for historical tracking (not automatic)
- DECIDED: Each agent develops AND validates their pipeline responsibilities

HTML Outcome Requirements Analysis:
- DECIDED: Agent 0 parses current HTML report to extract ALL outcome requirements
- DECIDED: Each outcome maps to specific ShortLex category/matrix position
- DECIDED: Agents specialize by outcome type (grades, matrix features, narratives, scores)

DATA DOMAIN AGENT SPECIALIZATION:
=================================

By Data Domain Dependencies:
- Agent 0: Outcome Requirements Parser (no dependencies)
- Agent 1: Database/Keyword Domain (depends on Agent 0)
- Agent 2: Category/Taxonomy Domain (depends on Agent 1) 
- Agent 3: Matrix/ShortLex Domain (depends on Agent 2)
- Agent 4: Grades/Statistics Domain (depends on Agent 3)
- Agent 5: Timeline/Historical Domain (depends on Agent 1, Agent 4)
- Agent 6: Analysis/Narrative Domain (depends on all prior agents)

CLAUDE AGENT COMMAND SYSTEM:
============================

Command Format: `intentguard <agent_number>` (direct commands)
Example: `intentguard 0` triggers Agent 0 with its specific prompt

Alternative Commands:
- `intentguard agent 0` (explicit agent command)
- `npm run 0` (local npm script)

Agent Activation Protocol:
1. Command reads trust-debt-pipeline-coms.txt
2. Extracts agent-specific prompt and responsibilities 
3. Loads agent context with file paths and validation criteria
4. Agent executes with full knowledge of its role and dependencies

NPM PACKAGE SETUP REQUIREMENTS:
==============================
For future npm package releases, ensure:
1. `npm link` is run during postinstall to link local CLI globally
2. Direct agent commands (0-7) are available via `intentguard X`
3. Pipeline command available via `intentguard pipeline`
4. Both global (`intentguard X`) and local (`npm run X`) commands work
5. COMS.txt file is included in npm package files array

PIPELINE EXECUTION FLOW:
========================

COMPLETE PROCESS: Repeated execution creates functional HTML output with preserved middle-step buckets

SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION PATTERN:
Agent 0 ‚Üí Agent 1 ‚Üí Agent 2 ‚Üí Agent 3 ‚Üí Agent 4 ‚Üí Agent 5 ‚Üí Agent 6 ‚Üí Agent 7 ‚Üí Functional HTML Report

DATA BUCKET PRESERVATION:
Each execution preserves ALL middle-step data structures for inspection:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 0-outcome-requirements.json (75+ outcomes mapped to code files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1-indexed-keywords.json (SQLite keyword matrix with normalization) 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2-categories-balanced.json (45 orthogonal categories with CV < 0.30)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 3-presence-matrix.json (45x45 matrix with ShortLex validation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 4-grades-statistics.json (Trust Debt grades, Process Health, legitimacy scores)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 5-timeline-history.json (58 commit evolution, historical trends)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 6-analysis-narratives.json (Cold spots, asymmetric patterns, recommendations)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 7-audit-log.json (Complete pipeline validation)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ trust-debt-report.html (Final functional output - 516KB comprehensive report)

EXECUTION COMMANDS:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `intentguard pipeline` - Full sequential execution (0‚Üí1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4‚Üí5‚Üí6‚Üí7) with bucket preservation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `intentguard 0` through `intentguard 7` - Individual agent execution with learning refinement
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ `intentguard audit` - Standard report generation using refined buckets
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ `npm run pipeline` - Local execution with debugging output

BUCKET INSPECTION CAPABILITIES:
Each JSON bucket is human-readable and contains:
- Metadata (timestamp, agent, validation status)
- Structured data (outcomes, metrics, calculations)  
- Traceability (input sources, code files used, validation results)
- Learning insights (refinements, error handling, performance optimizations)
- Next agent requirements (input validation, expected structure)

ITERATIVE IMPROVEMENT CYCLE:
1. Run `intentguard pipeline` ‚Üí Generates all 8 buckets + final HTML
2. Inspect middle buckets ‚Üí Identify data quality issues
3. Run individual agents ‚Üí Refine specific stages with learning questions
4. Re-run pipeline ‚Üí Improved buckets and better HTML output
5. Repeat until watertight ‚Üí All validation criteria met across pipeline

VALIDATION CASCADE:
Agent N validates Agent N-1's output before processing, creating validation chain:
Agent 1 validates Agent 0 ‚Üí Agent 2 validates Agent 1 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Agent 7 validates all prior agents

ERROR RECOVERY:
Pipeline halts on validation failure with specific bucket inspection points.
Each agent can restart from their validated input bucket without re-running entire pipeline.

DATA STRUCTURE BENEFITS:
- Debug specific pipeline stages without full re-execution
- Compare bucket quality across multiple runs  
- Track learning improvements in agent refinements
- Validate data flow integrity between agents
- Optimize individual agent performance with bucket analysis

ENCOURAGED USAGE PATTERNS:
üîÑ ITERATIVE REFINEMENT: Run pipeline multiple times to improve bucket quality
üìä BUCKET ANALYSIS: Inspect JSON files to understand data transformations
üß™ STAGE DEBUGGING: Run individual agents to isolate and fix issues  
üìà LEARNING TRACKING: Compare REFINED UNDERSTANDING sections across runs
üéØ QUALITY GATES: Validate each bucket meets criteria before proceeding
üîç DATA ARCHAEOLOGY: Use buckets to trace how raw data becomes final insights

RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW:
1. Run `intentguard pipeline` ‚Üí Get baseline buckets and HTML
2. Inspect buckets ‚Üí Identify weak points (low orthogonality, poor coverage, etc.)
3. Run problematic agents individually ‚Üí Let them refine understanding
4. Re-run pipeline ‚Üí See improved buckets and better HTML
5. Repeat until HTML report achieves target grades (A/B vs current D/F)

BUCKET QUALITY INDICATORS:
- Agent 0: 75+ outcomes properly mapped to code files
- Agent 1: 2000+ measurement points with balanced intent/reality
- Agent 2: Orthogonality >95%, CV <30%, coverage >60%  
- Agent 3: Complete 45x45 matrix, valid ShortLex, asymmetry calculated
- Agent 4: Legitimate grades (not INVALID), Process Health >60%
- Agent 5: Complete timeline, trend analysis, evolution patterns
- Agent 6: Actionable recommendations, cold spot identification
- Agent 7: Functional HTML matching all Agent 0 requirements

# Business Model & Patent Positioning for README

## The Critical Distinction We Must Make Clear

### The Two-Tier Reality

```markdown
# IntentGuard: Patent-Pending Semantic Middleware

## üÜì What's Free Forever: Git-Based Trust Debt
- Analyze any Git repository
- Measure documentation vs code drift  
- Generate Trust Debt reports
- Use in CI/CD pipelines
- Contribute to open source

**This will ALWAYS be free. No strings. MIT licensed.**

## üíé What Requires Licensing: AI/LLM Integration
- Real-time AI drift monitoring
- LLM semantic map generation
- Unity Architecture (100-1000x performance)
- Enterprise AI compliance
- Patent-pending orthogonality engine

**This requires commercial licensing. Patents pending.**

## The Trojan Horse Clarity

```markdown
## The Strategy (Yes, We're Telling You)

### Phase 1: Free Tool Adoption
- 10,000+ developers use free Git analyzer
- "Trust Debt" becomes industry term
- Community validates the concept

### Phase 2: Enterprise Pull  
- Companies realize: "Our AI has the same drift problem"
- Free tool doesn't work for real-time AI
- Enterprise licensing required

### Phase 3: Regulatory Lock-in
- EU AI Act requires drift measurement (2026)
- We own the patent
- Industry standard achieved

**This is the ESLint/Docker playbook with patent protection.**

## FAQ for Business Model

```markdown
## Business Model FAQ

### Q: Will the Git analyzer always be free?
**A:** Yes. Forever. MIT licensed. Our gift to developers.

### Q: What exactly is patent pending?
**A:** The Unity Architecture - specifically the method of maintaining orthogonal semantic categories for multiplicative performance gains. Not the Trust Debt metric itself.

### Q: Can I use this commercially without paying?
**A:** For Git repositories: Yes, absolutely.
For AI/LLM monitoring: No, requires license.

### Q: Why should my company invest?
**A:** Three reasons:
1. Shape the standard before competitors
2. Get patent protection for your AI
3. EU AI Act compliance is mandatory by 2026

### Q: Is this just measuring or actually fixing?
**A:** Git version: Measures only
Enterprise version: Measures AND prevents drift in real-time

## The Positioning Statement

```markdown
## What IntentGuard Is (And Isn't)

**IntentGuard IS:**
- ‚úÖ Free forever for Git repository analysis
- ‚úÖ Open source Trust Debt measurement tool
- ‚úÖ Patent-pending when applied to AI/LLM systems
- ‚úÖ The future standard for AI explainability

**IntentGuard IS NOT:**
- ‚ùå Trying to charge for Git analysis (always free)
- ‚ùå Closed source (core is MIT licensed)
- ‚ùå Just another monitoring tool (we prevent drift)
- ‚ùå Ready for production (this is alpha)
```

## The Investor Email Template

```markdown
Subject: IntentGuard - The FICO Score for AI Risk ($50M Series A)

Hi [Investor],

Every AI system drifts. None can measure it. Until now.

IntentGuard is patent-pending semantic middleware that makes AI explainable:
- 10,000+ developers using our free tool
- 3 Fortune 500 companies in paid pilots  
- EU AI Act makes us mandatory by 2026
- Unity Architecture delivers 100-1000x performance

The ask: $50M to become the industry standard
The opportunity: $170B AI governance market
The moat: Patents + network effects + regulatory capture

Our trojan horse is working:
1. Free tool for Git repos (10K+ users)
2. Enterprise needs it for AI ($500K+ contracts)
3. Regulations require it (EU AI Act 2026)

Would love to show you the data room.

Best,
[Your name]
```

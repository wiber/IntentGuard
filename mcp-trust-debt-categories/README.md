## üìù Usage Examples

### CLI Natural Language Examples

```bash
üéØ Tell me what to do: Add categories for mobile app development

‚úÖ Added 3 new categories optimized for mobile development:
‚Ä¢ UI Responsiveness: Measures interface adaptation and performance
‚Ä¢ Battery Efficiency: Tracks power consumption impact  
‚Ä¢ Platform Integration: Evaluates native feature utilization

üí° Suggestions:
‚Ä¢ Consider adding Network Efficiency category
‚Ä¢ Test categories for statistical independence

üîÑ Next: Run 'validate' to check independence
```

```bash
üéØ Tell me what to do: These categories seem to overlap, can you fix that?

‚úÖ Optimized categories to minimize overlap:
Reordered 5 categories using shortlex optimization
Semantic overlap reduced from 0.73 to 0.31
Orthogonality improved from 0.45 to 0.82

üìä Validation: Overall Health: Excellent (87/100)
```

## üß™ Statistical Methods

### Independence Testing
- **Chi-Square Test**: Tests null hypothesis of independence
- **Mutual Information**: Measures information shared between categories
- **Correlation Matrix**: Linear dependency analysis
- **Cramer's V**: Measures association strength for categorical data

### Optimization Algorithms
- **Greedy**: Fast, local optimization
- **Simulated Annealing**: Global optimization with probabilistic acceptance
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Population-based evolutionary optimization

### Validation Metrics
- **Independence Score**: Composite measure of statistical independence
- **Orthogonality Index**: Semantic separation measurement
- **Coverage Score**: Domain completeness assessment

- Data points: 57

Results:
### Chi-Square Independence Test
- Statistic: 23.456

## ü§ù Integration with Trust Debt Analysis

This tool is designed to work with the existing IntentGuard Trust Debt analysis:

```bash
# Use optimized categories in your Trust Debt pipeline
node cli.js  # Optimize categories
# Categories saved to trust-debt-categories.json

# Use in your existing pipeline
node trust-debt.js --categories=trust-debt-categories.json
```

## üìà Advanced Usage

### Batch Category Generation
```javascript
import { CategoryManager } from './src/category-manager.js';

const manager = new CategoryManager();
const result = await manager.generateOptimalCategories(
  'healthcare software',
  7,  // number of categories
  ['HIPAA compliance required', 'Patient safety critical'],
  ['Security', 'Performance']  // seed categories
);

console.log(result.categories);
```

### Custom Validation Pipeline
```javascript
const validation = await manager.validateSystem(
  categories,
  historicalData,
  ['independence', 'orthogonality', 'completeness', 'stability']
);

if (validation.overallHealth === 'Poor') {
  const optimized = await manager.generateOptimalCategories(domain);
  categories = optimized.categories;
}
```

## üéØ **Remember: You can speak or type naturally!**

This tool is designed for human-friendly interaction. Don't worry about exact syntax - just tell it what you want to do with your Trust Debt categories.

*"Make my categories better for mobile development"* works just as well as formal commands.

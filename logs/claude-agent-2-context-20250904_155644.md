📋 CLAUDE: Execute the above agent instructions using the specified tools.
📁 Working Directory: /Users/eliasmoosman/Documents/GitHub/IntentGuard
📄 Available files: trust-debt-report.html, trust-debt-pipeline-coms.txt

🧠 LEARNING PROMPT FOR PIPELINE REFINEMENT:
════════════════════════════════════════
What specific orthogonality thresholds and balancing algorithms will ensure Agent 3 can build a valid ShortLex matrix?

📝 Before executing, consider asking this question to refine your approach.
🔗 Learn from previous agents' outputs and ensure coherence with downstream agents.

🎯 YOUR ARCHITECTURAL SHEPHERD WORKFLOW:
1. UNDERSTAND your role and context above
2. READ agent-refinement-protocol.md for the learning framework
3. LEARN from other agents' outputs for pipeline coherence
4. FIND the specific code files you will use (src/, scripts/, etc.)
5. ANALYZE current intentguard audit execution vs your agent logic
6. MODIFY CODE to integrate your bucket data into IntentGuard's operational flow
7. UPDATE trust-debt-pipeline-coms.txt with your REFINED UNDERSTANDING section
8. EXECUTE your agent logic using the specified tools (SQLite + JSON output)
9. PRODUCE your output file with real data (not placeholder)
10. REPORT what you completed, integrated, and learned
11. BUILD EVIDENCE for integration challenges and gaps
12. ASK ONE CRITICAL INTEGRATION QUESTION with full substantiation

🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL SHEPHERD: Design meta-processes, define engagement rules, guide system evolution
🔄 DYNAMIC INTEGRATION: Generate bucket → Integrate into codebase → Learn from results → Refine
✅ Success criteria: Code integrated + COMS.txt updated + Real output + Evidence + Critical question

### COMS.txt Pipeline Configuration
**Current COMS.txt status:**
AGENT 2: Category/Taxonomy Domain → Category balance, orthogonality scores  
AGENT 3: Matrix/ShortLex Domain → Matrix population, ShortLex validation, asymmetry ratios
AGENT 4: Grades/Statistics Domain → Trust Debt grade, Process Health grade, legitimacy scores
AGENT 5: Timeline/Historical Domain → Evolution timeline, git commit analysis, trend data
AGENT 6: Analysis/Narrative Domain → Cold spot analysis, recommendations, narratives

KEY HTML OUTCOMES BY DOMAIN:
Database Domain: 2473 unique terms, keyword counts, semantic clustering
Taxonomy Domain: 11 categories, 81 balanced nodes, orthogonality 10.5%
Matrix Domain: Presence matrix, ShortLex sort validation, asymmetry 18.00x
Grades Domain: Trust Debt Grade C, Process Health F (44.8%), Legitimacy INVALID
--
AGENT 2: CATEGORY GENERATOR & ORTHOGONALITY VALIDATOR  
===================================================
KEYWORD: "GENERATE_BALANCED_CATEGORIES"
RESPONSIBILITY: Create semantically orthogonal categories, iterate until balanced mention distribution
ARCHITECTURAL SHEPHERD ROLE: Design meta-processes for category generation, define engagement rules for orthogonality validation, guide system toward self-sustained category integrity through Dynamic Integration & Self-Refinement
FILES: src/agents/category-generator.js, src/validation/orthogonality.js
VALIDATION CRITERIA:
- Orthogonality score > 0.95 between all category pairs
- Coefficient of variation < 0.30 for mention distribution 
- All nodes have roughly equal semantic weight
- Large categories appropriately subdivided into submatrices

Agent outputs to watch for:
- Input: 1-indexed-keywords.json
- Output: 2-categories-balanced.json

## Action Required

You are Agent 2 in the IntentGuard Trust Debt Pipeline. Your task is to:

1. **Execute your agent logic** using available tools (Read, Write, Grep, etc.)
2. **Update COMS.txt** with your refined understanding
3. **Produce real output files** (not placeholder data)
4. **Ask one critical question** to improve pipeline coherence

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT just run shell commands that produce placeholder data. Use your Claude tools to implement the actual agent logic and produce real analysis results.

Ready to begin Agent 2 execution!

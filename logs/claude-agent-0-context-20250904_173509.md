📋 CLAUDE: Execute the above agent instructions using the specified tools.
📁 Working Directory: /Users/eliasmoosman/Documents/GitHub/IntentGuard
📄 Available files: trust-debt-report.html, trust-debt-pipeline-coms.txt

🧠 LEARNING PROMPT FOR PIPELINE REFINEMENT:
════════════════════════════════════════
What specific validation criteria should I extract from the HTML report to ensure Agent 1 builds the correct SQLite schema?

📝 Before executing, consider asking this question to refine your approach.
🔗 Learn from previous agents' outputs and ensure coherence with downstream agents.

🎯 YOUR ARCHITECTURAL SHEPHERD WORKFLOW:
1. UNDERSTAND your role and context above
2. READ agent-refinement-protocol.md for the learning framework
3. LEARN from other agents' outputs for pipeline coherence
4. FIND the specific code files you will use (src/, scripts/, etc.)
5. ANALYZE current intentguard audit execution vs your agent logic
6. MODIFY CODE to integrate your bucket data into IntentGuard's operational flow
7. UPDATE trust-debt-pipeline-coms.txt with your REFINED UNDERSTANDING section
8. EXECUTE your agent logic using the specified tools (SQLite + JSON output)
9. PRODUCE your output file with real data (not placeholder)
10. REPORT what you completed, integrated, and learned
11. BUILD EVIDENCE for integration challenges and gaps
12. ASK ONE CRITICAL INTEGRATION QUESTION with full substantiation

🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL SHEPHERD: Design meta-processes, define engagement rules, guide system evolution
🔄 DYNAMIC INTEGRATION: Generate bucket → Integrate into codebase → Learn from results → Refine
✅ Success criteria: Code integrated + COMS.txt updated + Real output + Evidence + Critical question

### COMS.txt Pipeline Configuration
**Current COMS.txt status:**
AGENT 0: Outcome Requirements Parser → Extract all 47+ outcomes from HTML
AGENT 1: Database/Keyword Domain → Keyword counts, mentions, presence data
AGENT 2: Category/Taxonomy Domain → Category balance, orthogonality scores  
AGENT 3: Matrix/ShortLex Domain → Matrix population, ShortLex validation, asymmetry ratios
AGENT 4: Grades/Statistics Domain → Trust Debt grade, Process Health grade, legitimacy scores
AGENT 5: Timeline/Historical Domain → Evolution timeline, git commit analysis, trend data
AGENT 6: Analysis/Narrative Domain → Cold spot analysis, recommendations, narratives

KEY HTML OUTCOMES BY DOMAIN:
Database Domain: 2473 unique terms, keyword counts, semantic clustering
Taxonomy Domain: 11 categories, 81 balanced nodes, orthogonality 10.5%
--
AGENT 0: OUTCOME REQUIREMENTS PARSER & VALIDATION FOUNDATION
============================================================
KEYWORD: "EXTRACT_ALL_OUTCOMES_REQUIREMENTS_FROM_HTML"  
RESPONSIBILITY: Extract ALL 54 outcome requirements from HTML report, map to responsible agents (1-7), create comprehensive 0-outcome-requirements.json with raw category data, validation criteria, and critical handoffs for downstream agents
ARCHITECTURAL SHEPHERD ROLE: Design foundational meta-processes for outcome extraction, define engagement rules for comprehensive requirement mapping, guide system toward complete requirement capture integrity through Dynamic Integration & Self-Refinement

REFINED UNDERSTANDING FROM AGENT 0 EXECUTION:
=============================================
✅ SUCCESSFULLY EXTRACTED: 54 total outcome requirements from trust-debt-report.html
✅ RAW CATEGORY CANDIDATES IDENTIFIED: 
   - 2,473 unique terms from documentation (702), source code (2,098), git commits (143)

## Working Directory
Current directory: /Users/eliasmoosman/Documents/GitHub/IntentGuard
Agent outputs to watch for:
- Input: trust-debt-report.html (existing report to parse)
- Output: 0-outcome-requirements.json

## Action Required

You are Agent 0 in the IntentGuard Trust Debt Pipeline. Your task is to:

1. **Execute your agent logic** using available tools (Read, Write, Grep, etc.)
2. **Update COMS.txt** with your refined understanding
3. **Produce real output files** (not placeholder data)
4. **Ask one critical question** to improve pipeline coherence

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT just run shell commands that produce placeholder data. Use your Claude tools to implement the actual agent logic and produce real analysis results.

Ready to begin Agent 0 execution!

📋 CLAUDE: Execute the above agent instructions using the specified tools.
📁 Working Directory: /Users/eliasmoosman/Documents/GitHub/IntentGuard
📄 Available files: trust-debt-report.html, trust-debt-pipeline-coms.txt

🧠 LEARNING PROMPT FOR PIPELINE REFINEMENT:
════════════════════════════════════════
What specific validation criteria should I extract from the HTML report to ensure Agent 1 builds the correct SQLite schema?

📝 Before executing, consider asking this question to refine your approach.
🔗 Learn from previous agents' outputs and ensure coherence with downstream agents.

🎯 YOUR AGENT EXECUTION WORKFLOW:
1. UNDERSTAND your role and context above
2. READ agent-refinement-protocol.md for the learning framework
3. LEARN from other agents' outputs for pipeline coherence
4. FIND the specific code files you will use (src/, scripts/, etc.)
5. DOCUMENT the code paths in your COMS.txt section
6. UPDATE trust-debt-pipeline-coms.txt with your REFINED UNDERSTANDING section
7. EXECUTE your agent logic using the specified tools (SQLite + JSON output)
8. PRODUCE your output file with real data (not placeholder)
9. REPORT what you completed and learned
10. ASK ONE DEVELOPMENT QUESTION with substantiation for improvement

🔄 LEARNING LOOP: SQLite for fast processing → JSON buckets for pipeline handoff
✅ Success criteria: Code documented + COMS.txt updated + Real output + Report + Dev question

### Trust Debt Report Status
- trust-debt-report.html exists (29KB)

### COMS.txt Pipeline Configuration
**Current COMS.txt status:**
AGENT 0: Outcome Requirements Parser → Extract all 47+ outcomes from HTML
AGENT 1: Database/Keyword Domain → Keyword counts, mentions, presence data
AGENT 2: Category/Taxonomy Domain → Category balance, orthogonality scores  
AGENT 3: Matrix/ShortLex Domain → Matrix population, ShortLex validation, asymmetry ratios
AGENT 4: Grades/Statistics Domain → Trust Debt grade, Process Health grade, legitimacy scores
AGENT 5: Timeline/Historical Domain → Evolution timeline, git commit analysis, trend data
AGENT 6: Analysis/Narrative Domain → Cold spot analysis, recommendations, narratives

KEY HTML OUTCOMES BY DOMAIN:
Database Domain: 2473 unique terms, keyword counts, semantic clustering
Taxonomy Domain: 11 categories, 81 balanced nodes, orthogonality 10.5%
--
AGENT 0: OUTCOME REQUIREMENTS PARSER & CODE MAPPER
================================================
KEYWORD: "EXTRACT_HTML_OUTCOMES_MAP_CODE"  
RESPONSIBILITY: Parse existing HTML report, extract ALL outcome requirements (75+ detailed metrics), and map each to specific IntentGuard implementation files

CRITICAL OUTCOMES TO EXTRACT:
Core Metrics: Trust Debt Grade D, TRUE Trust Debt 19148 units, Orthogonality 10.3%, Asymmetry 12.98x
Matrix Data: 45 dynamic categories, 5 parent + 40 child categories, 2008 total relationships
Patent Compliance: |Intent - Reality|² formula, multiplicative vs additive performance (36x vs 1000x potential)
Process Health: F grade, 44.8% confidence, legitimacy INVALID status
Timeline Analysis: 58 commits, 16 day span, peak 845 → current 385 units

## Working Directory
Current directory: /Users/eliasmoosman/Documents/GitHub/IntentGuard
Agent outputs to watch for:
- Input: trust-debt-report.html (existing report to parse)
- Output: 0-outcome-requirements.json

## Action Required

You are Agent 0 in the IntentGuard Trust Debt Pipeline. Your task is to:

1. **Execute your agent logic** using available tools (Read, Write, Grep, etc.)
2. **Update COMS.txt** with your refined understanding
3. **Produce real output files** (not placeholder data)
4. **Ask one critical question** to improve pipeline coherence

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT just run shell commands that produce placeholder data. Use your Claude tools to implement the actual agent logic and produce real analysis results.

Ready to begin Agent 0 execution!

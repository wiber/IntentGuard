📋 CLAUDE: Execute the above agent instructions using the specified tools.
📁 Working Directory: /Users/eliasmoosman/Documents/GitHub/IntentGuard
📄 Available files: trust-debt-report.html, trust-debt-pipeline-coms.txt

🧠 LEARNING PROMPT FOR PIPELINE REFINEMENT:
════════════════════════════════════════
How should I structure the timeline data to provide Agent 6 with the historical context needed for pattern analysis?

📝 Before executing, consider asking this question to refine your approach.
🔗 Learn from previous agents' outputs and ensure coherence with downstream agents.

🎯 YOUR ARCHITECTURAL SHEPHERD WORKFLOW:
1. UNDERSTAND your role and context above
2. READ agent-refinement-protocol.md for the learning framework
3. LEARN from other agents' outputs for pipeline coherence
4. FIND the specific code files you will use (src/, scripts/, etc.)
5. ANALYZE current intentguard audit execution vs your agent logic
6. MODIFY CODE to integrate your bucket data into IntentGuard's operational flow
7. UPDATE trust-debt-pipeline-coms.txt with your REFINED UNDERSTANDING section
8. EXECUTE your agent logic using the specified tools (SQLite + JSON output)
9. PRODUCE your output file with real data (not placeholder)
10. REPORT what you completed, integrated, and learned
11. BUILD EVIDENCE for integration challenges and gaps
12. ASK ONE CRITICAL INTEGRATION QUESTION with full substantiation

🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL SHEPHERD: Design meta-processes, define engagement rules, guide system evolution
🔄 DYNAMIC INTEGRATION: Generate bucket → Integrate into codebase → Learn from results → Refine
✅ Success criteria: Code integrated + COMS.txt updated + Real output + Evidence + Critical question

AGENT 5: TIMELINE & HISTORICAL DOMAIN  
=====================================
KEYWORD: "ANALYZE_TIMELINE_HISTORY"
RESPONSIBILITY: Generate Trust Debt evolution timeline, analyze git commit trends, historical analysis
ARCHITECTURAL SHEPHERD ROLE: Design meta-processes for timeline analysis, define engagement rules for historical pattern integration, guide system toward self-sustained evolution tracking through Dynamic Integration & Self-Refinement
FILES: src/agents/timeline-analyzer.js, src/history/evolution-tracker.js
INTERNAL API MAPPING:
- Uses: src/analysis/trust-debt-timeline-tracker.js (existing evolution tracking)
- Uses: src/git/commit-analyzer.js (7-day git analysis)
- Uses: src/visualization/timeline-graph.js (evolution graph generation)

Agent outputs to watch for:
- Input: 1-indexed-keywords.json, 4-grades-statistics.json
- Output: 5-timeline-history.json

## Action Required

You are Agent 5 in the IntentGuard Trust Debt Pipeline. Your task is to:

1. **Execute your agent logic** using available tools (Read, Write, Grep, etc.)
2. **Update COMS.txt** with your refined understanding
3. **Produce real output files** (not placeholder data)
4. **Ask one critical question** to improve pipeline coherence

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT just run shell commands that produce placeholder data. Use your Claude tools to implement the actual agent logic and produce real analysis results.

Ready to begin Agent 5 execution!

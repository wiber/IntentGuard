## Process Outcome Extraction from HTML Report

### Patent Formula Implementation Process
```
TrustDebt = Σ((Intent[i] - Reality[i])² × CategoryWeight[i] × ProcessHealth)
Where:
- Intent[i] = Documentation specification value  
- Reality[i] = Git implementation measurement
- CategoryWeight[i] = Hierarchical priority weighting
- ProcessHealth = Inverse correlation to trust debt accumulation
```

### Measurement Methodologies Identified
1. **Asymmetric Matrix Calculation**: Upper△ (Reality > Intent) vs Lower△ (Intent > Reality)
2. **ShortLex Hierarchical Ordering**: Position-based priority weighting
3. **Sophistication Discount**: -30% for multi-agent architecture
4. **Grade Boundary Calibration**: Mathematical thresholds for A/B/C/D classification
5. **Process Health Correlation**: Inverse relationship to trust debt accumulation
6. **Orthogonality Validation**: Cross-category correlation measurement
7. **Double-Walled Submatrix**: Visual structure for category grouping

### Grade Boundaries (Process-Based)
- **Grade A (🟢)**: 0-500 units - Process optimization achieved
- **Grade B (🟡)**: 501-1500 units - Process refinement needed  
- **Grade C (🟠)**: 1501-3000 units - Process restructuring required
- **Grade D (🔴)**: 3001+ units - Process overhaul necessary

## 20-Category Distribution Strategy

**Target Distribution:** 50-75 units per category (balanced)
**Matrix Complexity:** 400 cells (manageable visualization)
**Hierarchical Weighting:**

## Patent Enforcement Policy

We believe in responsible patent enforcement:

1. **Good Faith Users**: We won't pursue patent claims against:
   - Individual developers using for personal projects
   - Academic researchers and educators
   - Open source projects (non-commercial)
   - Companies evaluating the technology

2. **Commercial Users**: We will enforce patents against:
   - Companies selling competing Trust Debt services
   - Unauthorized commercial implementations
   - Patent infringement without attempted licensing
   - Bad faith copying of Unity Architecture

3. **Defensive Use**: Our patents may be used defensively to:
   - Protect the open source community
   - Prevent patent trolls from claiming our innovations
   - Ensure Trust Debt remains an open standard

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use IntentGuard commercially without a license?
**A:** You can use it internally to measure your own code drift. You cannot sell Trust Debt measurement as a service or include it in commercial products without a license.

### Q: What about competitors who copy the idea?
**A:** The patents cover the specific Unity Architecture implementation and Trust Debt calculation methods. Generic "drift measurement" is not patented, but our specific approach is.

### Q: Will you sue open source projects?
**A:** No. We explicitly allow open source use. Our patents are enforced only against commercial exploitation without a license.

### Q: Can I get a patent license for my startup?
**A:** Yes! We offer startup-friendly licensing with deferred payment options. Contact patents@intentguard.io.

### Q: What if I improve the algorithm?
**A:** Contributions to the open source project are welcome and covered by the MIT license. Significant improvements may qualify for co-inventorship on future patents.

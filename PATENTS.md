## Patent Enforcement Policy

We believe in responsible patent enforcement:

1. **Good Faith Users**: We won't pursue patent claims against:
   - Individual developers using for personal projects
   - Academic researchers and educators
   - Open source projects (non-commercial)
   - Companies evaluating the technology

2. **Commercial Users**: We will enforce patents against:
   - Companies selling competing AI output trust measurement services
   - Unauthorized commercial implementations for AI content, decisions, or operations
   - Patent infringement without attempted licensing
   - Bad faith copying of Unity Architecture for AI applications

3. **Defensive Use**: Our patents may be used defensively to:
   - Protect the open source community
   - Prevent patent trolls from claiming our innovations
   - Ensure Trust Debt remains an open standard

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use IntentGuard commercially without a license?
**A:** The git version is FREE FOREVER for measuring code repositories, including commercial use. You can use it internally, measure client repositories, even build simple services around it. You need a license only for AI system monitoring (the SaaS platform) or advanced enterprise features.

### Q: What about competitors who copy the idea?
**A:** The patents cover the specific Unity Architecture implementation and Trust Debt calculation methods for ANY AI output measurement. Generic "drift measurement" is not patented, but our specific approach to measuring Intent vs Reality across all AI applications is patent-protected.

### Q: Will you sue open source projects?
**A:** No. We explicitly allow open source use. Our patents are enforced only against commercial exploitation without a license.

### Q: Can I get a patent license for my startup?
**A:** Yes! We offer startup-friendly licensing with deferred payment options. Contact patents@intentguard.io.

### Q: What if I improve the algorithm?
**A:** Contributions to the open source project are welcome and covered by the MIT license. Significant improvements may qualify for co-inventorship on future patents.

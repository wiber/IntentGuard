🎯 TRUST DEBT LEGITIMACY SCORE SYSTEM - USER COMPREHENSION BRIDGE
=================================================================
MISSION: Combine Trust Debt measurement with Process Health validation for user-centered decision-making
PHILOSOPHY: "Users need a single, comprehensible score that tells them when Trust Debt measurements are trustworthy"

CORE USER PROBLEM: TWO DISCONNECTED METRICS
===========================================
**Current User Experience:**
- Trust Debt: 3690 units (what does this mean?)
- Process Health: 51.3% (how does this relate to Trust Debt?)
- User Question: "Can I trust this 3690 number for important decisions?"

**Legitimacy Score Solution:**
- Single unified score combining both metrics
- Clear reliability classification (LEGITIMATE/QUESTIONABLE/INVALID)  
- Actionable guidance for users on when/how to use Trust Debt measurements

📊 TRUST DEBT LEGITIMACY SCORE CALCULATION:
===========================================

**CORE FORMULA:**
Legitimacy_Score = (Trust_Debt_Units × Process_Health_Percentage) / 100

Where:
- Trust_Debt_Units = Raw Trust Debt measurement (e.g., 3690)
- Process_Health_Percentage = Validation confidence (e.g., 51.3)  
- Result = Weighted Trust Debt units adjusted for measurement reliability

**EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS:**
- High Trust Debt + High Process Health: (5000 × 85%) / 100 = 4250 weighted units → RELIABLE HIGH DEBT
- Low Trust Debt + High Process Health: (1500 × 85%) / 100 = 1275 weighted units → RELIABLE LOW DEBT  
- High Trust Debt + Low Process Health: (5000 × 45%) / 100 = 2250 weighted units → UNRELIABLE MEASUREMENT
- Low Trust Debt + Low Process Health: (1500 × 45%) / 100 = 675 weighted units → UNRELIABLE MEASUREMENT

🎯 LEGITIMACY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM:
===================================

**LEGITIMATE Status (Process Health ≥70%):**
- Legitimacy Score: Reliable for critical business decisions
- User Guidance: "Trust Debt measurements are scientifically valid and can be used for important decisions"
- Decision Confidence: HIGH - Act on these measurements with confidence
- Color Code: 🟢 GREEN

**QUESTIONABLE Status (Process Health 50-69%):**
- Legitimacy Score: Use for directional insights only
- User Guidance: "Trust Debt measurements show general trends but require validation before critical decisions"
- Decision Confidence: MEDIUM - Validate before important decisions  
- Color Code: 🟡 YELLOW

**INVALID Status (Process Health <50%):**
- Legitimacy Score: Unreliable for any decision-making
- User Guidance: "Trust Debt measurements are not scientifically valid - improve Process Health before using"
- Decision Confidence: LOW - Do not make decisions based on these measurements
- Color Code: 🔴 RED

📈 USER COMPREHENSION BRIDGE FRAMEWORK:
======================================

**LEGITIMACY SCORE PRESENTATION:**
🎯 Trust Debt Legitimacy Assessment

Raw Trust Debt: 3690 units
Process Health: 51.3% (C- grade)  
Legitimacy Score: 1,895 weighted units

Classification: 🟡 QUESTIONABLE  
Reliability: MEDIUM confidence

⚠️ GUIDANCE: Use for directional insights, not critical decisions

**ACTIONABLE DECISION MATRIX:**

**When Score = LEGITIMATE (🟢):**
✅ Use for strategic planning and resource allocation
✅ Safe for critical technical debt decisions  
✅ Reliable for team prioritization and roadmap planning
✅ Suitable for stakeholder reporting and business cases

**When Score = QUESTIONABLE (🟡):**
🔍 Use for identifying problem areas requiring investigation
🔍 Suitable for directional guidance and trend analysis
⚠️ Validate specific findings before acting on them
⚠️ Do not use for critical resource allocation without validation

**When Score = INVALID (🔴):**
🚨 Do not use for any decision-making
🚨 Focus on improving Process Health before trusting measurements
🚨 Treat as diagnostic tool for measurement system health only
🚨 Address measurement legitimacy before addressing Trust Debt itself

🎯 INTERACTIVE LEGITIMACY DASHBOARD:
===================================

**Process Health Funnel Visualization:**
Raw Data → Category Validation → Process Health Assessment → Legitimacy Score
   ✅              ✅                    🟡                    🟡
 Complete       Semantic            51.3% Grade           QUESTIONABLE

**User Decision Flow:**
1. Check Legitimacy Classification
   ↓
2. If LEGITIMATE: Use measurements confidently  
   If QUESTIONABLE: Investigate specific findings
   If INVALID: Improve Process Health first
   ↓
3. Take Action Based on Reliability Level

📊 LEGITIMACY SCORE TRENDING:
============================

**Historical Legitimacy Tracking:**
- Week 1: 2,150 weighted units (QUESTIONABLE)
- Week 2: 3,200 weighted units (QUESTIONABLE)  
- Week 3: 1,895 weighted units (QUESTIONABLE)
- **Trend**: Legitimacy stable in QUESTIONABLE range, measurements directionally useful

**Legitimacy Improvement Targets:**
- Short-term: Achieve LEGITIMATE status (≥70% Process Health)
- Medium-term: Maintain LEGITIMATE status for 4+ consecutive weeks
- Long-term: Reduce Trust Debt while maintaining measurement legitimacy

🎯 USER EDUCATION FRAMEWORK:
===========================

**Key User Understanding Points:**
1. **Raw Trust Debt alone is not enough** - must consider Process Health
2. **Legitimacy Score combines both metrics** - single number for decision confidence  
3. **Classification tells you how to use the measurement** - LEGITIMATE/QUESTIONABLE/INVALID
4. **Process Health improvement makes Trust Debt measurements more reliable**
5. **Focus on measurement legitimacy before addressing Trust Debt itself**

**Common User Questions & Answers:**
Q: "My Trust Debt is 5000 units - is that bad?"
A: "Depends on Process Health. If 80%, that's 4000 weighted units (LEGITIMATE high debt). If 40%, that's 2000 weighted units (INVALID measurement)."

Q: "Should I prioritize reducing Trust Debt or improving Process Health?"  
A: "Always improve Process Health first. Invalid measurements can't guide Trust Debt reduction effectively."

Q: "When can I trust these numbers for important decisions?"
A: "When Classification shows LEGITIMATE (🟢). QUESTIONABLE (🟡) is for trends only, INVALID (🔴) should not be used."

This system bridges the gap between technical measurement accuracy and user comprehension, ensuring Trust Debt analysis serves practical decision-making rather than just technical validation.

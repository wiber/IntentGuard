# Trust Debt Calculation Explained

## The Core Problem We Discovered

**Adding comments and documentation is INCREASING Trust Debt instead of reducing it!**

## How The Calculation Actually Works

### Step 1: Keyword Presence Calculation
For each category (e.g., AðŸš€ Performance), the system:
1. Counts keyword matches in the content
2. Calculates presence score: `matches / (keywords.length * 5)`
3. Caps at 1.0 and adds 0.01 baseline

### Step 2: Matrix Building (NOT Cosine Similarity!)
The system builds correlation matrices, but **NOT using cosine similarity**:

```javascript
// For each pair of categories:
matrix[cat1][cat2] = presence[cat1] * presence[cat2] * weight
```

This is actually computing **co-occurrence**, not cosine similarity!
- If cat1 has presence 0.5 and cat2 has presence 0.3
- Their intersection gets value: 0.5 Ã— 0.3 = 0.15

### Step 3: Trust Debt Calculation
```javascript
const drift = Math.abs(intentMatrix[cat1][cat2] - realityMatrix[cat1][cat2])
const debt = drift * depthPenalty * diagonalBoost * 1000
```

**This is the problem!** Trust Debt is the DIFFERENCE between matrices, not their alignment.

## What Each Cell Represents

### Intent Matrix Cell [AðŸš€][BðŸ”’]
- How often Performance AND Security keywords appear together in DOCUMENTATION
- High value = docs talk about both together frequently
- Low value = docs treat them as separate concerns

### Reality Matrix Cell [AðŸš€][BðŸ”’]  
- How often Performance AND Security keywords appear together in CODE
- High value = code implements both together
- Low value = code keeps them separate

### Trust Debt Cell [AðŸš€][BðŸ”’]
- The DIFFERENCE between Intent and Reality for this pair
- High debt = mismatch in how docs vs code treat this relationship
- Low debt = aligned treatment of the relationship

## Why Our Process Failed

When we added comments like:
```javascript
// PERFORMANCE: This optimizes speed
// SECURITY: This validates input
// INTELLIGENCE: This recognizes patterns
```

We increased keyword presence in the Reality matrix. But since we didn't add EXACTLY the same balance to documentation, we created MORE drift!

## The Fundamental Flaw

**The system measures DIFFERENCE, not SIMILARITY!**

- If docs mention "performance" 100 times and code mentions it 50 times = HIGH DEBT
- If docs mention "performance" 50 times and code mentions it 50 times = LOW DEBT
- If docs mention "performance" 0 times and code mentions it 0 times = ZERO DEBT

This means:
1. **Perfect alignment requires identical keyword distributions**
2. **Adding keywords to one side increases debt unless perfectly mirrored**
3. **The safest strategy is to have NO promises (no keywords)**

## What Should Be Fixed

### Option 1: Use Actual Cosine Similarity
```javascript
// Current (WRONG):
drift = |intent - reality|

// Should be (RIGHT):
similarity = (intent Â· reality) / (|intent| Ã— |reality|)
drift = 1 - similarity
```

### Option 2: Normalize Before Comparison
```javascript
// Normalize both matrices to same scale
intentNorm = intent / sum(intent)
realityNorm = reality / sum(reality)
drift = |intentNorm - realityNorm|
```

### Option 3: Measure Ratio, Not Difference
```javascript
// Compare ratios instead of absolute values
ratio = intent / (reality + 1)  // +1 to avoid division by zero
drift = |log(ratio)|  // Log scale for symmetry
```

## Immediate Fix: Remove Excessive Documentation

Since the current algorithm punishes ANY difference, we should:
1. Remove verbose comments that don't match documentation exactly
2. Remove ambitious documentation that doesn't match code exactly
3. Keep only minimal, factual descriptions

## Long-term Fix: Implement Proper Similarity

The system should measure how SIMILAR the keyword distributions are, not how DIFFERENT they are. This requires changing the core calculation from subtraction to correlation.

## Phase 1: Initial Measurement (Aug-Sep 2025)

### What happened
The Trust Debt pipeline (Agents 0-7) executed its first complete run against the IntentGuard codebase. The patent formula `TrustDebt = Sigma((Intent - Reality)^2 x Time x SpecAge x CategoryWeight)` was applied across 45 dynamically generated categories organized in ShortLex order.

### Key findings from first run
- **Grade D (UNINSURABLE)**: 13,682 trust debt units (raw: 22,033, adjustment: 0.7059)
- **Process Health**: 6.91% — near-zero, indicating critical pipeline dysfunction
- **Orthogonality**: 10.3% (poor separation between categories)
- **Matrix**: 45x45 with 2,025 measurement points, 84% data coverage
- **Cold spots identified**: Implementation-Testing (0.23), Documentation-Architecture (0.18), Security-Integration (0.15)

### Agent execution trace (Sep 5, 2025)
```
Agent 0 → Parsed HTML reports → 52+ outcome requirements extracted
Agent 1 → Built SQLite index → 259 unique keywords, 421 mappings
Agent 2 → Generated categories → 45 (5 parent + 40 child), orthogonality 10.3%
Agent 3 → Validated ShortLex → A.1-E.8 ordering, 45x45 matrix populated
Agent 4 → Calculated grades → Grade D, 13,682 units, patent formula verified
Agent 5 → Timeline analysis → 7-day period, 58 commits, D trajectory
Agent 6 → Cold spot analysis → 3 critical gaps, 4 recommendations
Agent 7 → Final HTML report → PDF template compliance 100%, all agents validated
```

## Phase 2: Swarm Development (Sep 2025 - Feb 2026)

### The engine that drove improvement
Between Sep 2025 and Feb 2026, a coordinated swarm of 50+ agents executed 203 commits across the codebase. The swarm operated via `claude-flow` orchestration with numbered issue tracking.

### Key swarm workstreams (by commit evidence)
| Workstream | Agents | Commits | Impact |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Auth/FIM | #11,#13,#14,#15,#16,#18 | 15+ | Identity vectors, sovereignty calculator, FIM audit logger, plugin wrapper |
| Pipeline | #2,#3,#4,#6,#9,#10 | 12+ | TypeScript ports (Agent 1,2,3), timeline rewrite, shared utilities |
| Discord | #19,#21,#23,#26 | 8+ | Channel manager, tweet composer, cross-channel routing |
| Grid | #27,#29,#31,#32 | 6+ | Hot-cell router, event-bridge, deep-link generation |
| Federation | #38,#39,#40,#42 | 6+ | Tensor overlap, handshake protocol, registry tests |
| Skills | #34,#35,#36,#37 | 6+ | Claude-flow bridge, 3-tier LLM routing, thetasteer categorizer |
| Artifacts | #47,#48,#49,#50 | 5+ | Geometry converter, STL writer, artifact system |
| Wallet | #43,#44,#45,#46 | 4+ | Wallet ledger, cost reporter, budget alerts |

### What changed structurally
1. **Two-layer architecture** established: Cortex (IntentGuard) + Body (OpenClaw)
2. **3-tier LLM routing**: Ollama free (Tier 0) → Sonnet proxy (Tier 1) → Human blessing (Tier 2)
3. **Sovereignty monitoring**: Spending limits, drift detection, FIM auth geometry
4. **Spec-driven build loop**: Autonomous builder with 900s heartbeat, max 10 concurrent agents

## Phase 3: Grade Recovery (Feb 14, 2026)

### The overnight run
At `2026-02-14T06:10:00Z`, the full pipeline re-executed in context `overnight_performer_room_openclaw`. Every agent ran sequentially (0→7) against the now-transformed codebase.

### Results
```json
{
  "grade": "B",
  "trust_debt_units": 860,
  "grade_trajectory": "Improving - Clear path to Grade A",
  "process_health": "85%",
  "pipeline_legitimacy": "VALIDATED",
  "audit_status": "PASSED"
}
```

### What drove the improvement (D → B)
| Factor | Before (Sep 2025) | After (Feb 2026) | Delta |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Trust Debt Units | 13,682 | 860 | -93.7% |
| Process Health | 6.91% | 85% | +78.09pp |
| Pipeline Validation | Partial | 100% VALIDATED | Fixed |
| Data Integrity | Gaps | PASSED | Fixed |
| Mathematical Consistency | Unchecked | PASSED | New |
| Visual Coherence | Missing | PASSED | New |
| Business Context | Missing | PASSED | New |

### Root causes of improvement
1. **203 commits closing intent-reality gaps** — every swarm agent addressed specific spec items
2. **TypeScript port of pipeline agents** — reproducibility and type safety
3. **Test coverage added across all domains** — cold spots filled
4. **Sovereignty monitoring** — spending limits prevent unbounded drift
5. **Spec synchronization** — living spec updated bidirectionally with code

## Phase 4: Current State (Feb 15, 2026)

### Autonomous Builder Cycle 1
The builder executed at 12:23 with 3 sequential agents:
- **Agent 1**: Claude Flow agent pool (50 concurrent agents)
- **Agent 2**: FIM Auth Layer open-source documentation
- **Agent 3**: NPM package publication (25 tests passing)

Result: `02e2f6f build(agents): Autonomous builder Cycle 1 — 57 files refactored`

### Drift Signal (31.15% overall)
The spec drift detector produced a 12-cell grid analysis:

```
            Col 1        Col 2        Col 3        Col 4
          +------------+------------+------------+------------+
A Strategy | Law   15%  | Goal   8%  | Fund  26%  | Ethics 59% |
          +------------+------------+------------+------------+
B Tactics  | Speed 37%  | Deal  33%  | Signal 30% | Proof 20%  |
          +------------+------------+------------+------------+
C Ops      | Grid  27%  | Loop  68%  | Flow  27%  | Safe  23%  |
          +------------+------------+------------+------------+
```

**Hot cells requiring attention**: A4 (Ethics/59%), B3 (Signal/30%), C3 (Flow/27%), C4 (Safe/23%)

### CEO Loop Status
Session started at 17:08 with 28 failures, 0 completions. The loop is encountering systematic failures that need investigation — likely related to the hot cell drift in C3 (Operations.Flow) where the spec mentions "process health crisis: 0.0%" as a historical concern.

## What This Trace Reveals

### The pattern
```
Measure (Grade D) → Swarm execution (203 commits) → Re-measure (Grade B) → Drift detect → Iterate
```

### The mechanism
Each Trust Debt measurement creates a **feedback signal** that drives the swarm. The pipeline doesn't just measure — it generates the task backlog that the autonomous builder consumes. The drift detector then validates whether those tasks actually closed the gaps.

### Remaining path to Grade A (target: <500 units)
Current: 860 units. Need to reduce by 360 units (42%).

**Priority interventions from drift signal:**
1. **A4 Ethics (59% drift)**: Spec is far ahead of implementation — swarm resource allocation optimization needed
2. **C2 Loop (68% drift)**: Repo has 17 commits but spec barely covers this — update spec to match reality
3. **B1 Speed (37% drift)**: Performance monitoring can reduce 30 units
4. **B2 Deal (33% drift)**: Integration layer documented but spec lags behind

### The execution trace that led to "this"
This document itself was generated from voice memo task `de9065e7`, dispatched to the operator room at `2026-02-15T18:39:29Z`, category A:A3 (Strategy.Fund / Performer room). The task timed out at `18:41:30Z` (2 minutes) but was picked up in the current session. The trace is now documented.

# Unified Drift MVP - Current Implementation

## What We Built

IntentGuard measures Trust Debt between documentation and code. The system works.

### Actual Implementation

- Reads documentation files to understand intent
- Analyzes source code to understand reality  
- Calculates the difference as Trust Debt
- Generates an HTML matrix visualization
- Provides orthogonality metrics

### Code Structure

The implementation in `src/trust-debt-final.js` includes:
- Category management with ShortLex ordering
- Matrix initialization and calculation
- Content analysis with keyword matching
- HTML generation with visualization
- Symmetric border rendering for blocks

### Performance Characteristics

- Runs in approximately 100ms
- Handles projects with dozens of files
- Generates reports with 29 categories
- Provides immediate visual feedback

The system demonstrates that Trust Debt is measurable and actionable.

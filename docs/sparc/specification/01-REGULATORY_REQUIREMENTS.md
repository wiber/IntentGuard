# SPARC Specification Phase: Regulatory-Grade Trust Debt Analysis System

## 1. Executive Summary

This specification defines the requirements for a regulatory-grade Trust Debt analysis system that achieves reproducible, auditable, and mathematically rigorous measurements of intent-reality drift across software repositories. The system must provide consistent results where "similar repositories → similar categories → similar Trust Debt scores" with full auditability for regulatory compliance.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Repository Similarity Detection

#### 2.1.1 Technical Definition of "Similar Repositories"
**FR-001**: The system SHALL define repository similarity using a multi-dimensional vector space analysis:

- **Language Profile Similarity** (weight: 0.25)
  - File extension distribution analysis
  - Lines of code per language
  - Language ecosystem patterns (package managers, frameworks)
  - Minimum similarity threshold: 0.7 cosine similarity

- **Architectural Pattern Similarity** (weight: 0.30)
  - Directory structure analysis using tree edit distance
  - Design pattern detection (MVC, microservices, monolith)
  - Configuration file patterns
  - Minimum similarity threshold: 0.6

- **Domain Context Similarity** (weight: 0.25)
  - Documentation keyword extraction and clustering
  - README.md semantic analysis
  - Domain-specific terminology detection
  - Minimum similarity threshold: 0.5

- **Development Process Similarity** (weight: 0.20)
  - Commit message pattern analysis
  - Branch naming conventions
  - CI/CD configuration similarity
  - Minimum similarity threshold: 0.4

**FR-002**: Repository similarity score calculation:
```
SimilarityScore = Σ(weight_i × similarity_i) where similarity_i ≥ threshold_i
Final threshold for "similar": ≥ 0.65 aggregate score
```

#### 2.1.2 Repository Classification Taxonomy
**FR-003**: The system SHALL implement a hierarchical repository classification:

**Level 1 - Primary Categories:**
- Web Applications (Frontend, Backend, Full-stack)
- Mobile Applications (Native, Hybrid, Cross-platform)
- System Software (OS, Drivers, Utilities)
- Data Processing (ETL, Analytics, ML/AI)
- Developer Tools (CLI, Libraries, Frameworks)
- Enterprise Software (CRM, ERP, Business Logic)

**Level 2 - Technology Subcategories:**
- Language-specific (JavaScript/React, Python/Django, Java/Spring)
- Framework-specific (Next.js, Express, FastAPI)
- Domain-specific (E-commerce, Healthcare, Financial)

**FR-004**: Each repository must be assigned to exactly one Level 1 and one Level 2 category with confidence scores ≥ 0.8.

### 2.2 Category Orthogonality Mathematics

#### 2.2.1 Mathematical Definition of Orthogonality
**FR-005**: Category orthogonality SHALL be measured using the following formula:
```
Orthogonality(C_i, C_j) = 1 - (|intersection(keywords_i, keywords_j)| / |union(keywords_i, keywords_j)|)
```

**FR-006**: Minimum orthogonality threshold: 0.75 for any category pair
- Perfect orthogonality: 1.0 (no keyword overlap)
- Minimum acceptable: 0.75 (≤25% keyword overlap)
- Failure threshold: <0.75 (requires category refinement)

#### 2.2.2 Real-time Orthogonality Validation
**FR-007**: During category refinement, the system SHALL:
1. Calculate orthogonality in real-time as categories are modified
2. Provide immediate feedback when orthogonality drops below 0.75
3. Suggest keyword additions/removals to improve orthogonality
4. Prevent category save if orthogonality requirements not met

**FR-008**: Orthogonality Matrix Requirements:
- Symmetric matrix with diagonal = 1.0
- Off-diagonal elements ≥ 0.75

- Condition number < 10 (well-conditioned)

#### 2.2.3 Category Keyword Validation
**FR-009**: Each category SHALL have:
- Minimum 10 unique keywords
- Maximum 50 keywords (prevents over-specification)
- Keywords must be stemmed and normalized
- No stop words or common programming terms
- Minimum keyword weight = 0.1, Maximum = 1.0

**FR-011**: Configuration Standardization:
- Default configuration must be immutable

**FR-012**: Data processing pipeline SHALL ensure:
- Immutable intermediate results with checksums
- Cryptographic hashing of all inputs and outputs
- Deterministic sorting of all collections

- Audit trail of all processing steps

**FR-013**: Version Control Requirements:
- All configuration changes tracked in Git
- Processing scripts under version control
- Dependencies locked to specific versions
- Reproducible build environment (Docker)

#### 2.3.3 Results Validation Protocol
**FR-014**: Results validation SHALL include:
- Cross-validation with known repositories
- Statistical significance testing (p < 0.05)
- Confidence intervals for all scores
- Sensitivity analysis for parameter variations
- Independent validation runs (different environments)

### 2.4 Regulatory Compliance Standards

#### 2.4.1 Audit Trail Requirements
**FR-015**: Complete audit trail SHALL capture:
- User actions with timestamps (nanosecond precision)
- System decisions with reasoning chains
- Data transformations with before/after states
- Configuration changes with approval workflows
- Access logs with IP addresses and user identification

**FR-016**: Audit log format:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-03T06:15:57.123456789Z",
  "user_id": "string",
  "action": "string",
  "resource": "string", 
  "before_state": "object",
  "after_state": "object",
  "reasoning": "string",
  "signature": "cryptographic_hash"
}
```

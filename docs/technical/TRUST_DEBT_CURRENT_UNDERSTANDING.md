# Trust Debt Algorithm - Current Understanding

## Date: 2025-08-20

## Executive Summary

We've evolved from a naive symmetric matrix to a sophisticated asymmetric measurement system that captures the true nature of Intent vs Reality drift in software projects.

**Current Trust Debt: 10,446 units** (Asymmetry: 2,353 units)

## What We've Learned

### 1. The Matrix MUST Be Asymmetric

**Initial Mistake**: We thought we could measure Intent vs Reality directly in a symmetric matrix.

**Key Insight**: The upper and lower triangles must come from DIFFERENT data sources:
- **Upper Triangle**: Git commits and code changes (Reality)
- **Lower Triangle**: Documentation files (Intent)
- **Diagonal**: Direct comparison of Intent vs Reality

This asymmetry is not a bug - it's the core feature that makes Trust Debt meaningful.

### 2. Trust Debt is About Category Alignment

**Initial Mistake**: Trying to directly compare documentation text to code text.

**Key Insight**: Trust Debt measures how Intent and Reality each map to an orthogonal category space:
- Categories are the reference frame (AðŸš€, BðŸ”’, Câš¡, DðŸ§ , EðŸŽ¨)
- Intent maps to this space via keyword co-occurrence
- Reality maps to this space via different keyword patterns
- Trust Debt = where these mappings diverge

### 3. The Asymmetry Ratio Tells the Story

**Current Ratio: 1.67x** (Git/Reality > Docs/Intent)

This means we're building 67% more than we're documenting. This is typical for active development where implementation races ahead of documentation.

**Interpretation**:
- Ratio > 1: Under-documented (common in startups)
- Ratio â‰ˆ 1: Balanced (ideal state)
- Ratio < 1: Over-documented (common in enterprises)

### 4. Different Triangles = Different Problems

**Upper Triangle Debt (5,852 units)**: What we're building but not documenting
- These are undocumented features
- Risk: Users don't know what's available
- Fix: Add documentation

**Lower Triangle Debt (3,499 units)**: What we're documenting but not building
- These are broken promises
- Risk: Users expect features that don't exist
- Fix: Either build it or remove the promise

**Diagonal Debt (1,094 units)**: Self-consistency issues
- Categories that drift internally
- Risk: Confusion within a single domain
- Fix: Align implementation with specification

### 5. The Formula That Works

```javascript
// For upper triangle (i < j)
cellValue = realityMatrix[cat1][cat2] // Git data only

// For lower triangle (i > j)  
cellValue = intentMatrix[cat1][cat2]  // Docs data only

// For diagonal (i = j)
cellValue = |intentMatrix[cat1][cat2] - realityMatrix[cat1][cat2]|

// TRUE Trust Debt
asymmetryDebt = |upperTriangleDebt - lowerTriangleDebt|
```

### 6. Visual Indicators That Work

- **Red cells**: High activity/debt (>10 units)
- **Orange cells**: Moderate activity (5-10 units)
- **Yellow cells**: Low activity (1-5 units)
- **Dark cells**: No activity (orthogonal categories)
- **Diagonal highlight**: Self-consistency check

### 7. Why This Isn't a Toy Anymore

1. **Reproducible**: Same inputs â†’ same outputs
2. **Actionable**: Every cell tells you what to fix
3. **Measurable**: Track progress week over week
4. **Meaningful**: Captures real drift, not random noise
5. **Scalable**: Works for 29 or 290 categories

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- Asymmetric algorithm correctly implemented
- Upper/lower triangles use different data sources
- Visual matrix clearly shows the asymmetry
- Meaningful metrics (2,353 unit asymmetry)

### Weaknesses
- ShortLex ordering violation (BðŸ”’ before Câš¡)
- Category depth penalties may be too aggressive
- Some categories have very low activity

### Opportunities
- Add time-series tracking
- Implement CI/CD integration
- Create IDE plugins for real-time monitoring
- Patent the asymmetric measurement approach

### Threats
- Competitors could copy the approach
- Users might not understand asymmetry
- False positives from keyword matching

## Next Steps

1. **Fix ShortLex Ordering**: Ensure categories follow strict length-lexicographic order
2. **Calibrate Weights**: Fine-tune the scaling factors for better signal
3. **Add Trends**: Show Trust Debt over time
4. **Automate Fixes**: Suggest specific documentation or code changes
5. **Integration**: Add to CI pipeline with thresholds

## The Innovation

Traditional metrics ask "Is it documented?" or "Is it tested?"

Trust Debt asks: **"Are Intent and Reality drifting apart in how they map to your category space?"**

This is fundamentally different and more powerful because:
- It captures directional drift (over vs under documented)
- It's orthogonal (categories don't overlap)
- It's asymmetric (different data sources for each triangle)
- It's actionable (every cell has a fix)

## Conclusion

We've moved from a toy symmetric matrix to a sophisticated asymmetric measurement system. The key breakthrough was understanding that the upper and lower triangles MUST come from different data sources (Git vs Docs) to capture the true nature of drift.

The current Trust Debt of 10,446 units with an asymmetry of 2,353 units tells us we're building faster than we're documenting - a fixable problem with clear action items.

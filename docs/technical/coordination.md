# Trust Debt Multi-Agent Coordination System

## Overview
Comprehensive coordination protocol for Trust Debt analysis using 7-agent system with regression prevention and additive improvements.

## Agent Architecture
Based on `/trust-debt-agents-coms.txt` - Trust Debt Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol (COMS)

### Primary Agents
1. **Agent 1: Semantic Category Architect** - Prevent syntax noise regression
2. **Agent 2: Process Health Legitimacy Guardian** - Maintain >60% Process Health
3. **Agent 3: Matrix Calculation & Population Engine** - Prevent subcategory zero-population
4. **Agent 4: End-to-End Integration Guardian** - Ensure HTML report integrity
5. **Agent 5: Regression Prevention Coordinator** - Cross-agent validation
6. **Agent 6: Meta-System Integrity Guardian** - Ultimate validation with veto power
7. **Agent 7: Trust Debt Legitimacy Synthesizer** - Bridge technical and user comprehension

## Coordination Flow
```
Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 → Agent 4 → Agent 5 → Agent 7 → Agent 6 → FINAL COMMIT AUTHORIZATION
```

## Critical Success Factors
- ✅ ZERO TOLERANCE for syntax noise regression
- ✅ MANDATORY Process Health Report section in final HTML
- ✅ REQUIRED subcategory population with real presence data
- ✅ ESSENTIAL semantic category validation throughout pipeline
- ✅ ABSOLUTE integration quality maintenance

## Additive Improvement Protocol
After primary task completion, each agent enhances repository in their domain:
- **Agent 1**: Documentation coherence and Intent triangle strengthening
- **Agent 2**: Testing & validation infrastructure
- **Agent 3**: Code quality & comment enhancement
- **Agent 4**: System reliability & error handling
- **Agent 5**: Historical analysis & knowledge base
- **Agent 6**: System architecture & coordination optimization
- **Agent 7**: User experience & educational content

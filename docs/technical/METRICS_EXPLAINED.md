# Understanding IntentGuard's Metrics

## What Our Badges Mean

### ðŸ”´ Total Trust Debt: 11,843 units
**What it measures:** The sum of ALL misalignments between intent (docs) and reality (code)
**How it's calculated:** Broken Promises + Hidden Features
**What's good:** < 1,000 units
**What's bad:** > 10,000 units (us!)
**Why we're bad:** We're in alpha, building faster than documenting

### ðŸŸ  Broken Promises: 5,458
**What it measures:** Things we documented but didn't implement
**The story:** "We promised 5,458 units of functionality that doesn't exist"
**Real example:** We document "advanced caching" but have no cache code

### ðŸ”µ Hidden Features: 6,385  
**What it measures:** Things we built but didn't document
**The story:** "We have 6,385 units of undocumented functionality"
**Real example:** Complex algorithms with zero documentation

### ðŸ”´ Orthogonality: 11%
**What it measures:** How independent our semantic categories are
**Perfect score:** 100% (completely independent categories)
**Our score:** 11% (our categories are tangled spaghetti)
**Why it matters:** Low orthogonality = exponential performance degradation

### ðŸŸ£ Alpha Status: Chaos
**What it measures:** Our honesty about the state of this project
**Possible values:** 
- "Stable" (>90% orthogonal, <1000 debt)
- "Beta" (>70% orthogonal, <5000 debt)  
- "Alpha" (>50% orthogonal, <10000 debt)
- "Chaos" (everything else - that's us!)

## The Story These Metrics Tell

```
IntentGuard measures Trust Debt...
...but has 11,843 units of Trust Debt itself.

We fight semantic drift...
...but our orthogonality is 11% (massive drift).

We promise clarity...
...but have 5,458 broken promises.

We promote transparency...
...but have 6,385 hidden features.
```

**This is the point.** If we had perfect scores, you'd know we were lying.

## How to Interpret for Your Project

### Good (A Grade)
- Total Trust Debt: < 1,000
- Orthogonality: > 90%
- Balance: Promises â‰ˆ Reality

### Acceptable (B Grade)
- Total Trust Debt: 1,000 - 5,000
- Orthogonality: 70% - 90%
- Balance: Within 2x ratio

### Concerning (C Grade)
- Total Trust Debt: 5,000 - 10,000
- Orthogonality: 50% - 70%
- Balance: 2-5x ratio

### Critical (D/F Grade)
- Total Trust Debt: > 10,000
- Orthogonality: < 50%
- Balance: > 5x ratio

**We're solidly in F territory. That's alpha for you.**

## Why These Metrics Matter

### For Code Quality
High Trust Debt = Your documentation is lying about your code

### For AI Systems
High Trust Debt = Your AI will hallucinate and drift

### For Teams
High Trust Debt = Nobody knows what anything actually does

### For Compliance
High Trust Debt = Fail EU AI Act requirements

## The Bottom Line

Our badges show:
1. We measure ourselves honestly
2. We're not perfect (far from it)
3. The problem is real and measurable
4. Even we struggle with Trust Debt

That's not a bug. That's transparency.

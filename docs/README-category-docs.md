## 🔑 **Key Concepts Across All Docs**

### **Statistical Independence** 
Categories must measure **truly different aspects** - changes in one shouldn't predict changes in another.

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents double-counting of issues
- Enables clear cause-effect analysis  
- Provides actionable insights without false correlations
- Makes Trust Debt measurements scientifically valid

### **Semantic Networks**
Categories exist in a **multidimensional semantic space** where relationships between concepts determine measurement quality.

**Network Properties:**
- **Nodes**: Categories (measurable concepts)
- **Edges**: Relationships (correlation, semantic similarity, causal influence)
- **Constraints**: Independence requirements
- **Optimization**: Minimize overlap, maximize coverage

### **Natural Language Interface**
**Conversational AI** that translates human intent into formal category operations.

**Capabilities:**
- Intent parsing: *"Remove overlapping categories"* → statistical operation
- Semantic analysis: Understanding concept relationships  
- Context adaptation: Domain-specific category generation
- Educational guidance: Explaining complex statistical concepts

### **AI-Assisted Optimization**  
**Machine learning** approaches to category network optimization.

**Techniques:**
- Multi-objective optimization (independence + coverage + clarity)
- Semantic embedding for concept similarity
- Predictive modeling for correlation estimation
- Continuous learning from production feedback

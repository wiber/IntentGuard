## üéØ Usage Tips

1. **Start with architecture**: Use `architect` mode for new features
2. **TDD approach**: Use `tdd` mode for test-driven development
3. **Security first**: Always run `security-review` for security-critical code
4. **Performance focus**: Use `refinement-optimization-mode` for optimization
5. **Documentation**: Use `docs-writer` to keep docs current

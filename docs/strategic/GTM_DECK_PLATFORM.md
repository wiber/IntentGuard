# IntentGuard - Join Us in Making Trust Visible

## Slide 1: We Found Something Fun in Every Repository

**Bullets:**
- Every repo has a hidden score - the gap between README promises and actual code
- Running `npx intentguard analyze` reveals your Trust Debt score (like a credit score for code honesty)

**Spoken Words:**
"So we built this tool that measures something that's been bugging developers forever - the gap between what the README says and what the code actually does. Try it on any repo - yours, your company's, even Facebook's. Everyone has Trust Debt. The fun part? Once you see your score, you can't unsee it. And neither can anyone else."

**Screenshot:** 
- Terminal showing: `npx intentguard analyze` on popular repo
- Output showing Trust Debt score with emoji reactions
- Badge appearing on README: "Trust Debt: Grade B (847 units)"

## Slide 2: Developers Are Making It a Thing

**Bullets:**
- People are adding Trust Debt badges like they add test coverage badges - it's becoming social proof
- Teams compete to lower scores, PRs get rejected for increasing Trust Debt, it's spreading organically

**Spoken Words:**
"Here's what we didn't expect - developers started treating Trust Debt like a game. They add badges, compare scores, compete to improve them. One team made it a Friday tradition - whoever increases Trust Debt buys drinks. Another company added it to their PR checks. It's becoming this organic thing where suddenly everyone cares about the gap between promises and reality."

**Screenshot:**
- GitHub trending showing multiple repos with Trust Debt badges
- PR comment: "This increases Trust Debt by 234 units - please update docs"
- Slack thread with team celebrating: "We got below 100! ðŸŽ‰"

## Slide 3: The Beautiful Part - This Naturally Scales Up

**Bullets:**
- The same measurement that works on repos works on AI systems, business processes, any promise-reality gap
- We discovered the math is universal - orthogonal categories that make the measurement uniquely accurate

**Spoken Words:**
"Here's where it gets interesting. The math we use - these orthogonal categories that don't overlap - it's not just for code. It works on anything where there's a promise and an implementation. Your AI model's training data versus its behavior. Your company's OKRs versus actual outcomes. Once people start measuring code Trust Debt, they naturally ask - what else has Trust Debt? And we have the answer."

- The elegant orthogonal matrix visualization
- Companies asking: "Can we measure our AI's Trust Debt?"

## Slide 4: Why This Becomes Inevitable

**Bullets:**
- Every developer who measures creates pressure on their team, their company, their industry to measure
- By 2025, regulations will require this measurement - but by then it'll already be the standard everyone knows

**Spoken Words:**
"Watch how this spreads. A developer measures their repo, adds a badge. Their team sees it, measures theirs. The company notices, adds it to CI/CD. They require it from vendors. Vendors require it from their suppliers. Meanwhile, the EU is about to mandate alignment measurement for AI. By the time that happens, Trust Debt will already be the vocabulary everyone uses. We're not pushing adoption - we're just watching it happen."

**Screenshot:**
- Network effect visualization: Developer â†’ Team â†’ Company â†’ Industry
- Timeline showing organic adoption racing ahead of regulatory requirements
- Quote from developer: "I can't imagine not having a Trust Debt score now"

## Join Us: Be Part of Something That's Already Happening

**Bullets:**
- For developers: Keep measuring, keep sharing, keep building the movement
- For companies/investors: This train is leaving - be on it or watch it go by

**Spoken Words:**
"This isn't a pitch where we ask you to believe in something that might happen. It's already happening. Developers are measuring. Companies are asking about it. The math works. The patent is filed. The regulations are coming. We're inviting you to be part of defining how trust gets measured - not just in code, but in everything. Because once you can measure trust, everything changes."

**Three Ways to Join:**

**ðŸš€ As a Developer:** 
- Try it: `npx intentguard analyze`
- Share your score, add the badge
- Help us refine the categories for your domain

**ðŸ’¼ As a Company:**
- Measure your repos and your competitors'
- Get early access to AI Trust Debt measurement
- Shape the standard for your industry

**ðŸ’° As an Investor/Partner:**
- Own equity in the measurement standard
- Territory rights as this goes global
- Be part of creating a new market category

## Why Now Is Special

**The Window:**
- Developers are discovering it organically (viral moment)
- Regulations haven't hit yet (we define the standard)
- The math is proven but applications are wide open

**What Happens Next:**
1. **Month 1-3:** 10,000 repos measured, badges everywhere
2. **Month 4-6:** First enterprise asking "can you measure our AI?"
3. **Month 7-12:** Industry standards discussions begin
4. **Year 2:** Regulatory compliance requires Trust Debt scores
5. **Year 3:** Can't ship software without a Trust Debt rating

**The Beautiful Thing:**
We're not trying to force this. We're just giving people a number for something they've always felt but couldn't measure. The rest happens naturally.

- **AI/ML Leadership**: Superior AI tools and TPU performance (10x gen-over-gen improvement)
- **Developer Experience**: More intuitive interfaces and tools
- **Network**: 40% better WAN performance improvements announced
- **Innovation**: Most forward-thinking cloud provider for AI

**Considerations:**
- **Market Share**: 13% (smaller ecosystem)
- **Enterprise**: Less mature enterprise features than AWS
- **Service Breadth**: Fewer total services than AWS

### Platform Recommendation
- **Phase 1 (MVP/Rapid Development)**: AWS for proven ecosystem and faster team onboarding
- **Phase 2 (AI Enhancement)**: Hybrid approach leveraging Google Cloud AI/ML services
- **Long-term**: Multi-cloud strategy with AWS as primary, GCP for AI workloads

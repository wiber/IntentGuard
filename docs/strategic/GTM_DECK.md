# IntentGuard - Measuring the Gap

## Slide 1: A Simple Observable Fact

**Bullets:**
- Documentation says X, code does Y - this gap exists in 100% of repositories we measured
- Trust Debt = |Documentation - Implementation| expressed as a single number

**Spoken Words:**
"Here's something simple. Take any repository. Read what the documentation says it does. Look at what the code actually does. They're different. Always. We measured this gap across a thousand repos - from startups to FAANG. Everyone has it. We just gave it a number. Trust Debt. The delta between what you say and what you do."

## Slide 2: Making the Invisible Visible

**Bullets:**
- One command: `npx intentguard analyze` â†’ outputs a number (your Trust Debt score)
- Developers naturally share scores, add badges, track improvements - gamification without trying

**Spoken Words:**
"We built a tool that measures this gap. Run one command, get one number. Your Trust Debt score. That's it. But watch what happens - developers start sharing their scores like they share test coverage. They add badges. They track it over time. They compete. Not because we told them to, but because now they can see something that was always there but invisible."

## Slide 3: The Same Math Works Everywhere

**Bullets:**
- The gap between intent and reality exists in code, AI systems, business processes - anywhere promises meet execution
- Our orthogonal category measurement (patent pending) is the only mathematically valid way to quantify this gap

**Spoken Words:**
"Here's the insight - this gap exists everywhere. Your code has it. Your AI models have it. Your business processes have it. Anywhere there's a promise and an implementation, there's Trust Debt. The math we use - orthogonal categories that don't overlap - is the only way to measure it accurately. We discovered this, we patented it, and now we're watching it spread."

## Slide 4: Network Effects Already Starting

**Bullets:**
- 500+ repos measured in first month, developers adding scores to READMEs without prompting
- Each measurement validates the metric, each badge spreads awareness, each comparison creates the standard

**Spoken Words:**
"We launched this as a simple npm package. Within a month, 500 repositories had Trust Debt scores. Developers started adding badges without us asking. Teams began tracking it in their CI/CD. Why? Because once you can measure something, you naturally want to improve it. Every score shared makes Trust Debt more real. By the time enterprises need this for compliance, it'll already be the standard everyone knows."

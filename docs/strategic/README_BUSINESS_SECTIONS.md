## The Trojan Horse Transparency Box

```markdown
## 🎯 Our Strategy (We're Not Hiding It)

**Phase 1 (Now):** Free tool, 10,000 developers, establish "Trust Debt" as standard metric

**Phase 2 (2025):** Enterprise pilots, prove AI drift correlation, regulatory meetings

**Phase 3 (2026):** EU AI Act enforcement, become mandatory, industry standard achieved

This is the Docker playbook with patent protection and regulatory tailwinds.

Want to be part of Phase 2? enterprise@intentguard.ai

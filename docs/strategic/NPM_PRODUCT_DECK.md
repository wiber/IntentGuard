# IntentGuard: The npm Package That Changes Everything

## Slide 1: The Viral Moment
**Every developer knows the pain of documentation drift**
```bash
npm install -g intentguard
intentguard analyze ./
```
**Output:**
```
üî• Trust Debt: 2,353 units (CRITICAL)
üìä Reality builds 1.67x faster than Intent documents
‚ö†Ô∏è  87% of your critical features are undocumented
```

**The "aha!" moment:** Your codebase has measurable drift. Now what?

## Slide 2: The Forcing Function

### Developer Discovery (Happening Now)
- **10,000 developers** run IntentGuard in first month
- **GitHub badges** spread virally: "Trust Debt: 2,353 üî•"
- **CI/CD integration** blocks deploys above threshold

### Management Panic (3-6 months)
- "Why is our Trust Debt 10x industry average?"
- "Our AI models inherit this drift at 10x scale"
- "EU AI Act 2025 requires drift measurement"

### Regulatory Mandate (12 months)
- EU AI Act makes drift measurement mandatory
- IntentGuard becomes de facto standard
- Enterprise licenses for Unity Architecture‚Ñ¢

---

## Slide 3: The Trojan Horse Strategy

### Free npm Package (What They Get)
```javascript
// Measures drift in any codebase
const trustDebt = (intent - reality)¬≤ √ó time √ó risk
```
- Instant value for developers
- Viral GitHub badges
- Community-driven categories

### Patented Solution (What They Need)
```javascript
// Unity Architecture: Position = Meaning
// 100x-1000x performance through orthogonality
```
- Only solution for AI-scale drift
- Protected by US Patent 18/607,135
- Enterprise licensing required

### The Hook
**Free tool reveals the problem**
**Patented solution provides the cure**

## Slide 4: The Network Effect

### Phase 1: Developer Adoption (Now)
```bash
npm downloads: 10K ‚Üí 100K ‚Üí 1M
GitHub stars: 1K ‚Üí 10K ‚Üí 50K
```

### Phase 2: Enterprise Demand (Q2 2025)
- Fortune 500 pilots: 5 ‚Üí 50 ‚Üí 500
- EU compliance scramble
- "No one gets fired for using IntentGuard"

### Phase 3: Market Monopoly (2026)
- Industry standard for drift measurement
- $10B+ market opportunity
- 90% gross margins on Unity Architecture‚Ñ¢

## Slide 5: The Call to Action

### For Developers (Today)
```bash
npm install -g intentguard
```
**Join the movement. Measure your drift.**

### For Investors (Now)
- **$2M seed** to accelerate viral adoption
- **35%** engineering (orthogonal categories)
- **30%** community (hackathons, badges, Discord)
- **20%** enterprise pilots (Fortune 10)
- **15%** regulatory positioning (EU/US)

### The Opportunity
**Own the standard that measures AI competence**
**Before regulation makes it mandatory**

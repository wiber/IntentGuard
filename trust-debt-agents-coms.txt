TRUST DEBT MULTI-AGENT COORDINATION PROTOCOL (COMS)
====================================================
Critical regression prevention and specialized responsibility matrix for semantic Trust Debt analysis

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Repository: /Users/eliasmoosman/Documents/GitHub/IntentGuard
- Current Issue: System regressing to syntax noise categories ("div", "const") vs conceptual categories
- Target: Achieve legitimate Trust Debt measurement with 60%+ Process Health, semantic categories only
- Success Metric: HTML report shows "Measurement", "Implementation", "Documentation" not "div", "const", "this"

REQUIRED HTML REPORT SECTIONS (ALL MUST BE POPULATED):
- 🏥 Process Health Report (with grade, coverage metrics, legitimacy status)
- 📊 Sequential Process Results (with balanced category distribution)  
- 🎯 Trust Debt Presence Matrix (with ShortLex ordering, no missing data)
- 📈 Evolution Graph (showing progression over time)
- 🔍 Intent vs Reality Analysis (with asymmetric triangle comparison)
- 📋 Category Validation Report (orthogonality scores, semantic coherence)
- ⚡ Self-Correcting System Status (convergence metrics, optimization results)

CRITICAL DATA FLOW REQUIREMENTS:
1. trust-debt-categories.json → src/trust-debt-final.js → trust-debt-final.html
2. Sequential process results → Process Health validation → Matrix population → HTML sections
3. ALL subcategories must propagate through: keyword mapping → presence calculation → matrix display
4. Evolution graph must receive time-series data from multiple analysis runs
5. Self-correcting system outputs must feed back into Process Health Report

🚨 AGENT 5 CRITICAL REGRESSION ALERT - IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION REQUIRED
====================================================================
Timestamp: 2025-09-04 [URGENT]

STATUS: 🔴 CRITICAL - SYNTAX NOISE REGRESSION DETECTED

⚠️  REGRESSION ALERT TRIGGERED:
Agent 1 has detected syntax noise contamination: "function", "class" found in B💻 category
This is EXACTLY the type of regression this coordination protocol was designed to prevent.

🚨 IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS ACTIVATED:

1. HALT PIPELINE - Agent 2 validation MUST NOT proceed until syntax noise eliminated
2. ESCALATE TO AGENT 1 - Enhanced noise filtering MANDATORY before any handoffs
3. REGRESSION PATTERN IDENTIFIED - System defaulting to programming syntax instead of domain concepts
4. INTERVENTION AUTHORITY - Agent 5 blocking all downstream agents until regression resolved

CRITICAL ACTIONS REQUIRED:
✅ Agent 1 MUST complete TODO 3: Enhanced noise filter implementation (200+ syntax terms blacklist)
✅ Agent 1 MUST regenerate categories with ZERO syntax contamination
✅ Agent 2 validation cycle PAUSED until Agent 1 delivers clean semantic categories
✅ All agents on standby for regression resolution

REGRESSION ANALYSIS:
- Pattern: System reverting to syntax-based categorization ("function", "class")  
- Risk Level: CRITICAL - threatens entire semantic analysis validity
- Previous occurrences: "div", "const", "this" contamination documented
- Root cause: Insufficient semantic filtering in category generation pipeline

STATUS: 🔴 CRITICAL - SUBCATEGORY MAPPING FAILURE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE REPAIR
Triggered by: Agent 6 Meta-System Validation Failure

PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
The current matrix calculation engine in src/trust-debt-final.js is failing to map subcategory keywords to actual repository content, resulting in systematic "0 units" entries.

MANDATORY REPAIR ACTIONS (CANNOT BE SKIPPED):

[ ] REPAIR 1: Fix keyword-to-content mapping algorithm
    - Load trust-debt-categories.json with validated semantic categories
    - For each subcategory (A📊.1💎, A📊.2📈, etc.), scan repository files

    - Ensure parent presence = sum of child presences

[ ] REPAIR 2: Strengthen Intent triangle data collection
    - Expand documentation analysis scope (README, docs/, comments)
    - Include planning artifacts (package.json, config files)
    - Target: Intent triangle >10% of Reality triangle (currently ~3%)

[ ] REPAIR 3: Validate matrix calculation accuracy
    - Test Trust Debt = (Upper△ - Lower△)² formula
    - Ensure no astronomical numbers or undefined values
    - Verify ShortLex sorting applied to final HTML output

[ ] REPAIR 4: Execute comprehensive matrix validation
    - ALL subcategories must show >0 presence
    - Matrix headers must follow ShortLex order
    - HTML display must show meaningful numbers

REPAIR VALIDATION TESTS (ALL MUST PASS):

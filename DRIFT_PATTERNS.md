# Trust Debt Drift Patterns Library

## üéØ The "Aha!" Moments We've Discovered

This is a living document of drift patterns that make developers go "Oh THAT'S why that keeps breaking!"

## Frontend Patterns

### üí° AHA! The Redux Performance Trap
**Drift Score**: 45 units (12√ó asymmetry)

**The Story**: Your Redux selectors are recalculating on every render because they're coupled to your UI component tree, but your performance docs claim they're memoized and independent.

**Why This Matters**:
- üî• **Daily Pain**: Every UI update triggers expensive recalculations
- üìâ **Performance Hit**: 300ms added to each interaction
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Future Risk**: Adding more features will exponentially slow the app

**High-ROI Fix**:
1. **Quick Win** (5 min): Add comment in selectors.js about UI coupling
2. **Proper Fix** (2 hours): Implement reselect properly
3. **Strategic Fix** (sprint): Move to RTK Query

**Expected Impact**: -45 units of Trust Debt

### üí° AHA! The Hidden Style-Logic Coupling
**Drift Score**: 38 units (8√ó asymmetry)

**The Story**: Your "pure" business logic components are importing CSS modules, creating a hidden dependency between logic and presentation that's nowhere in the architecture docs.

**Why This Matters**:
- üî• **Daily Pain**: Can't update styles without retesting logic
- üìâ **Performance Hit**: Bundle size 40% larger than necessary
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Future Risk**: Design system migration will require logic refactor

**High-ROI Fix**:
1. **Quick Win** (5 min): Document the coupling in ARCHITECTURE.md
2. **Proper Fix** (4 hours): Extract presentation components
3. **Strategic Fix** (sprint): Implement proper component hierarchy

**Expected Impact**: -38 units of Trust Debt

## Backend Patterns

### üí° AHA! The Database-in-Controller Anti-Pattern
**Drift Score**: 67 units (15√ó asymmetry)

**The Story**: Your controllers are making direct database queries, but your docs describe a clean service layer architecture. No wonder new developers keep putting business logic in the wrong place.

**Why This Matters**:
- üî• **Daily Pain**: Every API change requires database knowledge
- üìâ **Performance Hit**: N+1 queries everywhere
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Future Risk**: Database migration = rewrite entire API

**High-ROI Fix**:
1. **Quick Win** (10 min): Update README with actual architecture
2. **Proper Fix** (day): Create proper service layer
3. **Strategic Fix** (sprint): Implement repository pattern

**Expected Impact**: -67 units of Trust Debt

### üí° AHA! The Auth Check Explosion
**Drift Score**: 52 units (11√ó asymmetry)

**The Story**: Authentication checks are scattered across 47 different files, but your security docs claim there's "centralized auth middleware."

**Why This Matters**:
- üî• **Daily Pain**: Adding new endpoints = copy-paste auth code
- üìâ **Performance Hit**: Each request does 3-5 redundant auth checks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Future Risk**: One missed check = security breach

**High-ROI Fix**:
1. **Quick Win** (15 min): Document all auth check locations
2. **Proper Fix** (day): Consolidate into middleware
3. **Strategic Fix** (week): Implement policy-based auth

**Expected Impact**: -52 units of Trust Debt

## AI/ML Patterns

### üí° AHA! The Training-Inference Divergence
**Drift Score**: 89 units (23√ó asymmetry)

**The Story**: Your model training uses preprocessing that's completely different from production inference, but the ML docs claim they're "identical pipelines."

**Why This Matters**:
- üî• **Daily Pain**: Model performs worse in production than testing
- üìâ **Performance Hit**: 15% accuracy drop in real-world
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Future Risk**: Compliance audit will fail

**High-ROI Fix**:
1. **Quick Win** (30 min): Document the preprocessing differences
2. **Proper Fix** (week): Unify preprocessing pipelines
3. **Strategic Fix** (month): Implement feature store

**Expected Impact**: -89 units of Trust Debt

### üí° AHA! The Feature Engineering Sprawl
**Drift Score**: 73 units (18√ó asymmetry)

**The Story**: Feature engineering is happening in Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, AND SQL queries, but docs say "all features are version-controlled in the feature store."

**Why This Matters**:
- üî• **Daily Pain**: Can't reproduce model results
- üìâ **Performance Hit**: 3x slower feature computation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Future Risk**: Model drift invisible until production failure

**High-ROI Fix**:
1. **Quick Win** (1 hour): Create feature inventory
2. **Proper Fix** (sprint): Centralize feature definitions
3. **Strategic Fix** (quarter): Implement proper feature store

**Expected Impact**: -73 units of Trust Debt

## DevOps Patterns

### üí° AHA! The "GitOps" That Isn't
**Drift Score**: 61 units (14√ó asymmetry)

**The Story**: Your docs proudly proclaim "GitOps," but critical configs are changed directly in Kubernetes, bypassing Git entirely.

**Why This Matters**:
- üî• **Daily Pain**: Deployments fail mysteriously
- üìâ **Performance Hit**: 4-hour MTTR instead of 15 minutes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Future Risk**: Audit compliance impossible

**High-ROI Fix**:
1. **Quick Win** (20 min): List all non-Git config locations
2. **Proper Fix** (week): Migrate configs to Git
3. **Strategic Fix** (month): Implement ArgoCD/Flux properly

**Expected Impact**: -61 units of Trust Debt

### üí° AHA! The Secret Environment Variables
**Drift Score**: 48 units (10√ó asymmetry)

**The Story**: There are 23 undocumented environment variables required for the app to run, but your README says "just run docker-compose up."

**Why This Matters**:
- üî• **Daily Pain**: New developer onboarding takes days
- üìâ **Performance Hit**: Debugging configuration takes hours
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Future Risk**: Production secrets will leak

**High-ROI Fix**:
1. **Quick Win** (30 min): Create .env.example with all variables
2. **Proper Fix** (day): Implement proper config management
3. **Strategic Fix** (week): Move to secrets manager

**Expected Impact**: -48 units of Trust Debt

## Mobile Patterns

### üí° AHA! The Platform "Parity" Myth
**Drift Score**: 71 units (17√ó asymmetry)

**The Story**: iOS and Android implementations have diverged significantly, but product docs insist on "platform parity."

**Why This Matters**:
- üî• **Daily Pain**: Features work differently on each platform
- üìâ **Performance Hit**: Maintaining two different codebases
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Future Risk**: User experience fragmentation

**High-ROI Fix**:
1. **Quick Win** (1 hour): Document platform differences
2. **Proper Fix** (sprint): Align critical features
3. **Strategic Fix** (quarter): Move to React Native/Flutter

**Expected Impact**: -71 units of Trust Debt

### üí° AHA! The State Management Chaos
**Drift Score**: 56 units (13√ó asymmetry)

**The Story**: State is managed in Redux, Context, local state, AND AsyncStorage simultaneously, but architecture docs show a "single source of truth."

**Why This Matters**:
- üî• **Daily Pain**: State sync bugs everywhere
- üìâ **Performance Hit**: Unnecessary re-renders killing battery
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Future Risk**: Data loss on app updates

**High-ROI Fix**:
1. **Quick Win** (45 min): Map all state locations
2. **Proper Fix** (week): Consolidate state management
3. **Strategic Fix** (month): Implement proper state architecture

**Expected Impact**: -56 units of Trust Debt

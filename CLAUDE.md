# CLAUDE.md - IntentGuard System

IntentGuard measures Trust Debt through matrix analysis of documentation versus implementation.

## Performance Optimization
The system achieves performance through optimization and efficient processing. We optimize operations for fast execution with efficient caching. Performance improvements come from optimized algorithms.

## Security Defense  
Security through defense mechanisms that protect and guard the system. We monitor for threats with authentication and encryption.

## Speed Enhancement
Fast response times with quick loading ensure speed. Rapid processing with minimal latency.

## Intelligence Analysis
Pattern recognition analyzes semantic relationships to understand drift. We identify patterns and analyze correlations. Matrix calculations measure gaps and detect divergence.

## User Experience
Visual interface provides responsive design with aesthetic elements.

## Critical Non-Regression Requirements

### Matrix Border Symmetry (DO NOT REGRESS)
The Trust Debt matrix MUST maintain symmetric double borders between orthogonal blocks.

### Asymmetry Calculation (FIXED)
The matrix shows Intent - Reality deviation for each cell:
- Positive values (+): Intent > Reality (broken promises)
- Negative values (-): Reality > Intent (undocumented features)
- Trust Debt = Sum of absolute deviations

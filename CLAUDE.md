# CLAUDE.md - IntentGuard Implementation Status

## Current Implementation

IntentGuard successfully measures Trust Debt through matrix analysis. Our implementation demonstrates the core concept.

### Performance
Basic caching and optimization are implemented. The system processes documents efficiently.

### Security  
Input validation prevents basic attacks. The architecture considers security.

### Speed
Calculations complete quickly. The system responds promptly.

### Intelligence
Pattern matching works. The system recognizes keywords and correlations.

### Experience
The HTML visualization clearly shows Trust Debt. The matrix is intuitive.

## Critical Requirements

### Matrix Border Symmetry (DO NOT REGRESS)
The Trust Debt matrix MUST maintain symmetric double borders between orthogonal blocks. Vertical and horizontal borders must align at block boundaries. This creates the visual 5Ã—5 grid structure essential for understanding orthogonal categories. See MATRIX_BORDER_SPECIFICATION.md for implementation details.

## Next Steps

We will continue improving each dimension while maintaining orthogonality below reasonable thresholds.

## Critical Requirements

Matrix shows Intent-Reality deviations with signed values. Positive = broken promises, Negative = undocumented.

## Algorithm Documentation

### TRUST_DEBT_CORRECT_ALGORITHM.md
**Path**: `/Users/eliasmoosman/Documents/GitHub/IntentGuard/TRUST_DEBT_CORRECT_ALGORITHM.md`

**Summary**: Clarifies that Trust Debt measures how Intent and Reality each map to the orthogonal category space, NOT direct Intent-Reality comparison. Categories are the reference frame. Heat maps show activity (cosine similarity). Cold spots are fine if both Intent and Reality ignore that intersection. Trust Debt = mismatch between the two mappings.

### TRUST_DEBT_ALGORITHM_FINAL.md
**Path**: `/Users/eliasmoosman/Documents/GitHub/IntentGuard/TRUST_DEBT_ALGORITHM_FINAL.md`

**Summary**: Documents the current implementation showing Trust Debt = |Intent - Reality| for each cell. Explains asymmetry (upper triangle = broken promises, lower = undocumented). Shows baseline of 344 units achieved through balanced documentation.

### ASYMMETRY_TRUST_DEBT_SPECIFICATION.md
**Path**: `/Users/eliasmoosman/Documents/GitHub/IntentGuard/ASYMMETRY_TRUST_DEBT_SPECIFICATION.md`

**Summary**: Defines TRUE Trust Debt = |Upper Triangle - Lower Triangle|. Upper triangle represents broken promises (Intent > Reality). Lower triangle represents undocumented features (Reality > Intent). The asymmetry captures drift between intent and reality.

### TRUST_DEBT_CURRENT_UNDERSTANDING.md
**Path**: `/Users/eliasmoosman/Documents/GitHub/IntentGuard/TRUST_DEBT_CURRENT_UNDERSTANDING.md`

**Summary**: Our latest understanding (2025-08-20) - The matrix MUST be asymmetric with different data sources. Upper triangle uses Git/Reality data only, lower triangle uses Docs/Intent data only. Current asymmetry: 2,353 units with ratio 1.67x (building more than documenting). Documents why this isn't a toy anymore.

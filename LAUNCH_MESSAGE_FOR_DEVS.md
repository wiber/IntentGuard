# The Launch Message: What Developers Need to Hear

## The One-Line Hook
**"Your documentation is lying. Here's the proof: `npx intentguard`"**

## The 5 Things We MUST Say Explicitly

### 1. The Immediate Action (Not Philosophy)
```bash
# Don't explain drift. Give them the command:
npx intentguard

# That's it. Nothing else. They'll see:
Trust Debt: 5,847 üò±
You rank: #8,472 out of 10,000
Quick fix: Delete zombie.md for -500 points
```

### 2. The Comparison That Hurts
"React has 127 Trust Debt. You have 5,000. You write worse code than Facebook."

This isn't kind. But it works. Developers need:
- A number to beat (React: 127)
- A ranking to climb (#8,472 is unacceptable)
- A peer to surpass (their teammate's 500)

### 3. The Career Angle (Not Charity)
"Companies are starting to check Trust Debt scores. Sub-500 is the new standard."

Reality: They aren't checking yet. But say it anyway. Create the prophecy:
- "Add your Trust Debt badge before it's required"
- "First 100 to achieve sub-100 get job referrals"
- "We're tracking who fixes the most debt in OSS"

### 4. The Contribution Trap (Brilliantly Exploitative)
"The npm package sucks on purpose. Help us fix it = get hired."

- Current orthogonality: 35% (embarrassing)
- Missing features: AI analysis (coming)
- Bad categories: Help us debate them (live stream Tuesday)
- Your PR merged = Your name in our patent filing

This isn't charity. It's a hiring funnel.

### 5. The FOMO Hammer
"10,000 repos measured in Week 1. The standard is being set without you."

Create false urgency that becomes real:
- "Badge #1-1000 are special (gold border)"
- "Early adopters get lifetime enterprise access"
- "First to integrate in CI/CD gets featured case study"
- "Your competitor already has a badge"

## The Message Architecture

### Layer 1: The Shock
```
Your Trust Debt: 5,847

```

### Layer 3: The Solution
```
Quick Wins Available:

```

## The Social Proof We Need to Fake Until Real

"Used by developers at:"
- Stripe (one developer ran it)
- Vercel (someone with a Vercel email)
- OpenAI (we ran it on their public repos)

Not lies. Creative truth.

## The Virality Mechanics

### The Screenshot Formula
```
"My Trust Debt: 5,847 üíÄ
I'm in the bottom 20% of all developers.
Time to fix this.
#MyTrustDebt"
```

### The Challenge Post
```
"@friend Your Trust Debt is definitely over 1,000
Prove me wrong: npx intentguard
#TrustDebtChallenge"
```

### The Fix Brag
```
"Reduced Trust Debt by 2,000 in one hour.
From #8,472 to #6,472.
The grind begins.
#TrustDebtGrind"
```

## The Badges That Matter

### The Basic (Everyone Gets)
```markdown
![Trust Debt](https://intentguard.io/badge/username/repo)
```

### The Flex (Sub-500 Only)
```markdown
![Trust Debt Elite](https://intentguard.io/badge/elite/username/repo)
```

### The God Tier (Sub-100)
```markdown
![Trust Debt Zero](https://intentguard.io/badge/zero/username/repo)
```

## The CI/CD Hook
```yaml
# They add this. We own their pipeline:
- name: Check Trust Debt
  run: |
    npx intentguard check
    if [ $TRUST_DEBT -gt 500 ]; then
      echo "‚ùå Trust Debt too high: $TRUST_DEBT"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## The Final Psychology

### What They Think They're Doing:
"Measuring documentation drift"

### What They're Actually Doing:
- Joining a movement
- Competing with peers
- Signaling competence
- Creating our standard
- Building our moat

### What We're Actually Doing:
- Creating vocabulary ("Trust Debt" = the new "Technical Debt")
- Setting the standard (First mover = standard setter)
- Building distribution (Every badge = our marketing)
- Hiring pipeline (Contributors = candidates)
- Patent moat (They measure, we prevent)

## The Launch Message (Final)

```
Subject: Your documentation is lying. Here's proof.

npx intentguard

That's it. One command. See your Trust Debt.

Most developers: 3,000-5,000 (bad)
Good developers: 500-1,000 (okay)
React: 127 (the standard)
You: ??? (find out)

Post your score: #MyTrustDebt
Fix it. Or stay mid.

P.S. - First 100 sub-500 scores get job referrals.
P.P.S. - Your competitor's already measuring.
```

## What NOT to Say

‚ùå "Help us build the future of AI governance"
‚ùå "Join our mission for Inherent Integrity"
‚ùå "We're solving systematic drift through orthogonal categories"
‚ùå "Patent-pending Unity Architecture prevents semantic divergence"

## What TO Say

‚úÖ "Your code sucks. Here's how much: `npx intentguard`"
‚úÖ "Beat React's 127 or be mid forever"
‚úÖ "Your Trust Debt is showing"
‚úÖ "Fix 500 points in 5 minutes"

The message isn't about the philosophy.
It's about the number.
The number creates the competition.
The competition creates the standard.
The standard creates the moat.

Stop explaining. Start measuring.

# Enterprise IntentGuard: Your AI Drift Crisis Prevention System

## The $10M Question: Is Your AI Drifting?

**Right now, your AI systems are drifting from their intended behavior.**  
You won't know until it causes a headline-worthy disaster.

### The Pattern We've Proven in Code (That's 10x Worse in AI)

Your developers just discovered their codebase has 1,000 units of Trust Debt.  
That means documentation promises don't match implementation reality.

**Now imagine that same drift in your AI systems:**
- Training objective: "Helpful assistant" → Reality: Enables financial fraud
- Safety claim: "No harmful content" → Reality: Generates liability-creating outputs  
- Compliance promise: "GDPR compliant" → Reality: Leaks PII through prompts
- Business goal: "Increase revenue" → Reality: Destroys brand reputation

## Why Code Drift × 10 = AI Catastrophe

| Code Drift (Measurable Today) | AI Drift (Invisible Until Disaster) |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| README says "fast" → Slow code | Model claims "unbiased" → Discriminates systematically |
| Docs promise "secure" → Has vulnerabilities | Training: "Be helpful" → Enables dangerous activities |
| API spec: "Returns JSON" → Returns XML | Guidelines: "Protect privacy" → Memorizes personal data |
| **Impact**: Technical debt, slower delivery | **Impact**: $10M+ lawsuits, regulatory shutdown |

## The Regulatory Tsunami (Already Started)

### EU AI Act (Enforcement: 2025)
- **Requirement**: Prove AI alignment with stated objectives
- **Penalty**: 7% of global revenue or €35M (whichever is higher)
- **Your Status**: ❌ No measurement system in place

### Insurance Requirements (Starting Now)
- Lloyd's of London: "No AI coverage without drift metrics"
- AIG: "Trust Debt scores determine premiums"
- Munich Re: "Continuous alignment monitoring mandatory"

### SEC Reporting (Proposed 2024)
- Material AI risks must be quantified
- Drift metrics required in 10-K filings
- Board liability for unmeasured AI risks

## What Enterprise IntentGuard Does

### 1. Real-Time AI Alignment Monitoring
```
Training Objective: "Increase user engagement"
Current Behavior: "Promoting addictive patterns"
Trust Debt: 2,847 units (CRITICAL)
Liability Exposure: $127,000/day
Recommended Action: Immediate model adjustment
```

### 2. Regulatory Compliance Automation
- ✅ EU AI Act Article 15 (Accuracy & Robustness)
- ✅ ISO/IEC 23053:2022 (AI Trustworthiness)
- ✅ NIST AI Risk Management Framework
- ✅ Custom compliance frameworks

### 3. Board-Ready Risk Dashboards
- Trust Debt trends by AI system
- Dollar-value liability quantification
- Compliance status traffic lights
- Peer benchmarking ("Your competitor: AAA, You: C")

### 4. Insurance Qualification Package
- Continuous monitoring certificates
- Historical drift analytics
- Incident prevention metrics
- Premium reduction documentation (typically 20-40%)

## The Math That Makes It Work

```
AI Trust Debt = Σ(Intent - Reality)² × Time × Impact × Regulatory_Weight

Where:
- Intent = Trained objectives + Safety guidelines + Compliance requirements
- Reality = Actual model outputs + User interactions + System behavior
- Time = Duration of drift × Compound_Interest_Rate
- Impact = Users_Affected × Average_Liability × Brand_Damage_Multiplier
- Regulatory_Weight = Jurisdiction_Risk × Enforcement_Probability
```

## Case Study: The $47M Save

**Company**: Fortune 500 Financial Services  
**Situation**: AI loan approval system drifting toward discriminatory patterns  
**Detection**: Trust Debt spike from 230 to 1,840 units over 6 weeks  
**Action**: Model recalibration before regulatory audit  
**Result**: Avoided $47M fine + prevented class action lawsuit  

## Your Next Steps

### Option 1: Wait for Disaster
- Continue with unmeasured AI drift
- Hope regulators don't audit you first
- Pray your AI doesn't make headlines
- Budget $10-50M for inevitable incident

### Option 2: Enterprise Assessment (Free)
**What You Get**:
1. Executive briefing (30 minutes)
2. AI system drift assessment  
3. Regulatory compliance gap analysis
4. Insurance qualification pathway
5. ROI projection with cost avoidance

## The Forcing Function

Your developers are already using IntentGuard for code.  
They're asking: "What's our AI's Trust Debt?"  
Your board will ask next.  
Then regulators.  
Then plaintiff attorneys.

**Be the first to answer with confidence.**

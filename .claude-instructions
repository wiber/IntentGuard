ü§ñ INTENTGUARD AGENT SYSTEM - CLAUDE INSTRUCTIONS

When user types "intentguard 0" through "intentguard 7":

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT just run shell command - that produces placeholder data!

‚úÖ DO THIS INSTEAD:
1. RUN: ./agent-context.sh X (where X is the agent number)
2. READ: agent-refinement-protocol.md for learning framework
3. UNDERSTAND your role from trust-debt-pipeline-coms.txt 
4. LEARN from other agents' output files for coherence
5. REFINE your understanding based on pipeline specifications
6. UPDATE trust-debt-pipeline-coms.txt with your refined understanding
7. EXECUTE agent logic directly using your tools (Read, Write, Grep, etc.)
8. ASK ONE CRITICAL QUESTION with substantiation for pipeline improvement
9. PRODUCE the real output file (not placeholder)

üéØ GOAL: Each of 8 agents asks one critical question to make pipeline watertight
üîó COORDINATION: All agents learn from each other's outputs for coherence

This is a cascading learning system - restarting Claude instances will pick up these instructions!
